## {#what-is-data-wrangling data-menu-title="What is data wrangling?"}

[What do we mean by "data wrangling?"]{.slide-title}

<hr>

>*"Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is **the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format** with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics."*

::: {.right-align-text}
-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)
:::

. . . 

[Wrangling includes (but is not limited to):]{.body-text-m}

- **data cleaning** (e.g. handling missing values, consistent naming of observations, ensuring variables are the correct data types, etc.)
- **restructuring data** (e.g. tidying data (i.e. convert from wide > long format))
- **combining data sets** (e.g. using key values to merge two related data sets)

. . . 

[Wrangling is a critical first step in building any sort of data visualization!]{.body-text-m}

You may have heard something like, "Data scientists spend 80% of their time preparing their data for analysis and / or visualization." And while that may not be totally accurate for all data scientists or all projects, you *will* spend lots of time wrestling with data.

## {#tidy-format data-menu-title="Tidy data"}

[`{ggplot2}` plays best with *tidy* data]{.slide-title}

<hr>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-alt: "Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads 'Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.' On the left reads 'In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.' There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure."

**Reminder:** tidy data is not a `{ggplot2}`-specific concept. It's a broadly standardized way of organizing data.

## {#tidyverse data-menu-title="Tidyverse"}

[The `{tidyverse}` provides lots of helpful tools]{.slide-title2}

The data science workflow, as described by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund in [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro), with added [`{tidyverse}` packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) as they fit within this workflow.

**Note** that there are a number of other non-tidyverse packages that are also incredibly helpful too (e.g. `{janitor}`, `{naniar}`)!

[Let's wrangle some fracking data]{.slide-title}

> *Since [launching in 2011](https://www.fracfocus.org/learn/about-fracfocus), **[FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/) has become the largest registry of [hydraulic fracturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking) chemical disclosures in the US**. The database, available to explore online and [download in bulk](https://fracfocus.org/data-download), contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job, plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is [managed](https://fracfocus.org/about-us) by the [Ground Water Protection Council](https://www.gwpc.org/overview/), “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of state ground water regulatory agencies”. As seen in: The latest [installment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/25/climate/fracking-oil-gas-wells-water.html) of the New York Times’ [Uncharted Water series](https://www.nytimes.com/series/uncharted-waters).*

## {#messy-data data-menu-title="FracFocus' messy data"}

[Download fracking data from Google Drive!]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

::: {.center-text .body-text-m}
**You should already have downloaded these data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vR0Ppc8YaIsHmAOluxeOtmKu1DG_WaR9/view?usp=sharing)**
:::

We snagged these data back in November 2023 when they were still *quite* messy. Since then, (it seems that) FracFocus has done a bit more pre-processing of these data -- meaning the data you download from their [online portal](https://fracfocus.org/data-download) is already a whole lot cleaner. This is great(!), but also defeats the purpose of this exercise {{< fa face-smile title="smiling face" >}}.
