## {#high-level-feedback data-menu-title="High-level feedback"}

[Consider high-level feedback . . .]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.center-text .body-text-m}
**where the focus is on whether a data visualization is accurate, relevant and understandable for the intended audience**
:::

<br>

  - does the visualization address the defined question? if so, how? if not, what's missing or confusing?
  - what important trends do you see? are your eyes drawn to them? if yes, how? if no, how can you better highlight them?
  - what other context might be helpful for understanding this visualization (maybe the author has already considered this for the final deliverable!)? 
  - is this visualization approachable for its intended audience? if yes, how so? if no, why not?
  - consider the graphic form -- does it make sense for these data types?

[. . . and detail-oriented feedback:]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.center-text .body-text-m}
**where the focus is on aesthetics choices (e.g. colors, typefaces, layout, themes, white space, etc.) and how those choices help to enhance / tell the story**
:::

<br>

  - is the color palette colorblind-friendly?
  - are colors used to convey any messages or overall theme? would you change them to improve this?
  - are the typefaces legible? do they contribute to the overall theme?
  - do elements look crunched or appropriately spaced out?
  - any non-data elements that should be moved or removed for clarity or simplicity?

. . . 

::: {.center-text .body-text-m}
**Remember:** all critiques should be accompanied by actionable recommendations for improvement!
