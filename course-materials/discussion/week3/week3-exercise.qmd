::: {.callout-note}
It's up to you to organize your own `week3-discussion.qmd` file (i.e. there is no template). You may (should) discuss and work through today's exercise with a partner (or two!).
:::

## Example 1: `{palmerpenguins}` ggplot

1. Copy the following code into your `week3-discussion.qmd` file and add code chunk options that:
    - render the output (i.e. plot), but not the code
    - suppress any warnings or messages
2. Add alt text using the `fig-alt:` code chunk option
3. "Inspect" your plot (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```

## Example 2 (from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/learning/lesson-plans/teach-about-climate-change-with-30-graphs-from-the-new-york-times.html){target="_blank"}):

1. Download this viz (right click > Save Image As... > save to your class repo)
2. Embed the viz in `week3-discussion.qmd` using Markdown syntax *and* add alt text:

```{md}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
![](file/path/to/your/image){fig-alt="Alt text goes here"}
```

3. "Inspect" your image (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML 

::: {.callout-note}
This graphic form is called a [**dot plot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)){target="_blank"}. 

Dot plots are particularly useful for visualizing variability within a single measured numerical variable -- here, that's how much temperature deviates from the 20th-century average for each month in a given year. Year is treated as a categorical variable.

It's easy to confuse dot plots with scatter plots, which alternatively are used to visualize a relationship between two (or sometimes three) numeric variables.

## Example 3 (Fig 1A from [Chapman et al. 2024](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh8874){target="_blank"}):

1. Download this viz (right click > Save Image As... > save to your class repo)
2. Embed the viz in `week3-discussion.qmd` using HTML syntax *and* add alt text (you'll also need to include the `width` attribute to make the image a bit smaller):

```{html}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
<img src="file/path/to/image" alt="Alt text goes here" width="700px">
```

3. "Inspect" your image (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML

The associated figure caption for this figure: 

>The >2.6 billion species observations in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database are disproportionately from high-income countries.
