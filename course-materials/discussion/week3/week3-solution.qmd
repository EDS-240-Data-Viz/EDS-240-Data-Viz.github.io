## Your answers might look a bit different! Discuss with your own answers with one another.

While you should generally follow the [alt text formula](week3-alt-text-slides.qmd#alt-text-formula){target="_blank"}, your final answers may look a bit different than those listed here.

## Example 1: `{palmerpenguins}` ggplot

**Alt text:** A histogram of penguin body masses where Gentoo penguins have body masses that are about 37% larger than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| 
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

# get mean body mass for each species ----
body_mass_means <- penguins |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(mean_bm = mean(body_mass_g))

# get means of each ----
adelie_mean <- body_mass_means |> filter(species == "Adelie") |> pull(mean_bm)
chinstrap_mean <- body_mass_means |> filter(species == "Chinstrap") |> pull(mean_bm)
gentoo_mean <- body_mass_means |> filter(species == "Gentoo") |> pull(mean_bm)

# calculate what percent larger gentoo body masses are, as compared to the mean of chinstraps and adlies ----
mean_ac <- mean(adelie_mean, chinstrap_mean)
perc_larger <- ((gentoo_mean - mean_ac) / mean_ac) * 100

# create plot ----
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```

## Example 2 (from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/learning/lesson-plans/teach-about-climate-change-with-30-graphs-from-the-new-york-times.html){target="_blank"}):

**Alt text:** A dot plot of monthly global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average, where monthly global temperatures are increasing over time. Nearly every month since the mid-1970s is warmer than the 20th-century average, with 12 record-breaking hot months occurring between 2015-2023.

## Example 3 (Fig 1A from [Chapman et al. 2024](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh8874){target="_blank"}):

**Alt text:** A heatmap of global species observations where the highest concentration of observations occur in high-income countries, particularly in the USA and European nations.
