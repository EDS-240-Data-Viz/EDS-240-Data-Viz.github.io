## {#what-is-alt-text data-menu-title="What is alt text?"}

[What is alt text?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>
<br>

[[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) defines alternative text, aka alt text, as:]{.body-text-m} 

<br>

> ...a textual substitute for non-text content in web pages.

<br>

. . .

**In other words, alt text is a written description that conveys the meaning / messaging of visual elements (e.g. photos / images, media, *data visualizations*).**

## {#why-alt-text data-menu-title="Why alt text?"}

[Alt text serves many different communities and functions]{.slide-title3}

<hr>

<br>

[**Just a few examples:**]{.body-text-m .teal-text}

::: incremental
1. Alt text is read aloud by assistive technologies, like screen readers, **helping users with visual or certain cognitive disabilities** to perceive the content and function of visual elements on web pages

2. Alt text will appear in place of visual elements for those who are using a **slow internet connection**, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth

3. Alt text may serve those with **"situational limitations,"** such as viewing a computer screen in bright sunlight

4. Alt text provides more **accurate image descriptions / context to search engine crawlers**, which improves their assessment of a page's purpose and content

. . .

[**Because of this, it's important that we include good alt text with any data visualizations we publish online!**]{.teal-text}

## {#writing-alt-text data-menu-title="Writing alt text"}

[A formula for writing alt text]{.slide-title}

<hr>

Data viz designer and instructor, [Amy Cesal](https://www.amycesal.com/), suggests this rule of thumb for writing alt text for data visualizations: **alt=“[Chart type]{style="background-color:#FFE600"} of [type of data]{style="background-color:#6DFFF8"} where [reason for including chart]{style="background-color:#74FF75"}**.

<br>

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "50%"
#| fig-alt: "Colored stripes of chronologically ordered temperatures where they increase in red to show the warming global temperature"
knitr::include_graphics("images/hawkins-warming-stripes.png")
```

[**alt="[Colored stripes]{style="background-color:#FFE600"} of [chronologically ordered temperatures]{style="background-color:#6DFFF8"} where [they increase in red to show the warming global temperature]{style="background-color:#74FF75"}"**]{.body-text-s}

## {#alt-vs-cap data-menu-title="Alt vs. caption"}

[Include *both* a figure caption & alt text]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

A [**figure caption**]{.teal-text} is text that is displayed on the screen (typically beneath the data visualization it's associated with) and is used to provide additional information and context. 

[**Alt text**]{.teal-text} is *not* rendered on screen, but is identified and read aloud by screen readers. It's used to describe the main takeaway(s) of a data visualization.

## {#tips data-menu-title="Tips"}

[Additional tips for writing alt text for data visualizations]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

In addition to the formula presented on the last couple slides, consider the following tips: 

<br>

::: incremental
- **write in sentence case, but keep it short** (alt text is read linearly by screen readers, which means that people can’t go back a word if they missed something)
- **carefully consider the use of special characters** ([this article](https://www.elevenways.be/en/articles/screenreaders-special-characters) details "safe" vs. "unread" characters)
- **link to the data or source** (not in your alt text, but somewhere in the surrounding text or figure caption)

## {#adding-alt-text data-menu-title="Adding alt text"}

[Adding alt text]{.slide-title}

<hr>

Include alt text with your data visualizations, no matter how you choose to embed them:

1. If you're rendering ggplot (or other data visualization) code within a `.qmd` file, add the `fig-alt` code chunk option:

```{{r}}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Figure caption text goes here"
#| fig-alt: "Alt text goes here"
ggplot(...) +
  geom_*()
```

<br>

2. If you've save your data visualization as an image file, you can embed it in a `.qmd` file using either **markdown** or **html** syntax:

:::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.center-text .gray-text}
**Markdown**
:::
```{html}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
![Figure caption goes here](file/path/to/image){fig-alt="Alt text goes here"}
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.center-text .gray-text}
**HTML**
:::
```{html}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
<img src="file/path/to/image" alt="Alt text goes here">
```
:::

## {#checking-alt-text data-menu-title="Checking your alt text"}

[Check to make sure your alt text was applied]{.slide-title2}

<hr>

(In Chrome) **Right click** on an image > **Inspect** to look at the underlying HTML of a webpage. You should see `alt="Your alt text."`. For example, right clicking on the image on slide 4 should reveal something that looks like this: 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/check-alt-text.png")
```
