[What is the U.S. Drought Monitor?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

[The [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/){target="_blank"} (USDM) is a collection of measures that allows experts to assess droughts in the United States.]{.body-text-m}

<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>
It is produced through a partnership between the [National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://drought.unl.edu/){target="_blank"}, the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/){target="_blank"} and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"}. You can download and explore comprehensive statistics through their [data portal](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx){target="_blank"}.

[What is the TidyTuesday?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday){target="_blank"} is a "weekly social data project" organized by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/){target="_blank"}. It's goal is to **"make it easier to learn to work with data, by providing real-world datasets."**

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidytuesday.png")
```

Since 2018, participants of all skill levels have imported, wrangled, and visualized weekly data sets, then shared their creations + code on social media. It's a fun, low-stakes way to learn new data visualization skills and approaches from one another -- check it out!

## {#usdm-tidytuesday data-menu-title="USDM x TidyTuesday"}

[USDM x TidyTuesday]{.slide-title}

<hr>

The TidyTuesday community wrangled and visualized USDM data back in 2021 ([2021-07-20, week 30](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md){target="_blank"}), so we'll use the `{tidytuesdayR}` package to import some <sup>*</sup>minimally-tidied data.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidytuesday-usdm.png")
```

<br>

::: {.footer}
<sup>*</sup>TidyTuesday always provides the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md#cleaning-script){target="_blank"} that the organizers used to pre-process any of the data provided -- these USDM data comprise three separate data sets, which were converted from wide to long format, joined together, and had some columns renamed.

## {#gameplan data-menu-title="Our gameplan"}

[Let's recreate this USDM viz!]{.slide-title}

<hr>

In our next two discussion sections, we'll be recreating this data visualization produced by U.S. Drought Monitor (you can find on the [*Droughts in California* Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_in_California)!):

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/usdm.png")
```

**This week, we'll focus on the data layer, geometric layer, and scales.** Next week, we'll work on tweaking the theme (all non-data elements) to get it to look just like the U.S. Drought Monitor's version.
