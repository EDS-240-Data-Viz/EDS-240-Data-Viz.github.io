### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("monochromeR") # a package for creating monochrome color palettes and easily converting rgba values to hex codes (and also some other useful functions)
install.packages("showtext") # for using fonts more easily in R graphs
install.packages("glue") # for string interpolation (aka helps us insert variables directly into text strings)
install.packages("ggtext") # improved text rendering support for ggplot2
install.packages("ggrepel") # ggplot2 extension to repel overlapping labels
```

### B. Download Font Awesome fonts

We'll learn how to use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/){target="_blank"} icons in our ggplots. To do so, you'll need to download the Font Awesome font files and save them to your class repo. Do so by following these steps:

1. **Download Font Awesome fonts:** Go to [https://fontawesome.com/download](https://fontawesome.com/download){target="_blank"} and download the latest release available. Choose the **Free For Desktop** option.
2. **Unzip the downloaded file:** You should see a folder inside called `otfs/` -- this contains three `.otf` files (aka OpenType font format files)
3. **Copy the three `.otf` files to your class repo:** I recommend creating a `fonts/` folder inside your root directory, and dropping all three of them in there (e.g. `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/fonts/*.otf`)

### C. Download .qmd templates & review data wrangling code

1. Download all necessary templates (links in the table below) and save them to a `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/week7/` folder.

2. Review setup / wrangling / base plot code and make note of any questions you might have. Due to time constraints, we won't be live-coding our way through all code in class. However, we'll reserve some time to answer any questions before we jump into data viz {{< fa face-smile title="a smiling face" >}}. Specifically:
    - Template 7 begins where we left off in creating our dumbbell plot (in the [amounts / rankings lecture](lecture-slides/SLIDES-amounts-rankings.qmd){target="_blank"}). Review the code under the `## Setup`, `## Wrangle Data` and `## Create plot` sections to re-familiarize yourself. *We'll use this single template for both lectures this week.*

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-lab Prep {#pre-lab-prep} 

::: {.callout-important}
## TODO
- develop critique form that can be submitted to instructors & to peer
:::

From here on out, we'll be using lab sections to share drafts of final project data visualizations and receive feedback from peers. Please complete the following before coming to section:

### A. Prepare your data viz slide 

[FPM #3](assignments/FPM3.qmd){target="_blank"}, asks you to draft all three required visualizations that will become a part of your [final project infographic](assignments/final-project.qmd){target="_blank"}. Find your assigned slide from the Google Slide deck (see table, under the [Lab Materials](week7.qmd#lab-materials) section, below) and add the following:

1. ***one*** of your three visualizations
2. the question that you're visualization helps to answer

The visualization you bring should meet the [FPM #3](assignments/FPM3.qmd){target="_blank"} requirements (see part V under the [Description](assignments/FPM3.qmd#partV){target="_blank"} section) -- this should be a well-constructed, carefully thought-through and polished plot. You should be prepared to discuss your design choices and receive constructive feedback from your peers.

### B. Read up on how to give / receive feedback

Giving, receiving *and* implementing feedback is an important part of any creative process (including building data visualizations!). **Review the tips in the drop down, below:**

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
## Important tips for giving / receiving / implementing feedback:

The following tips were largely adapted from this [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-improve-your-data-visualizations-feedback){target="_blank"}.

**For giving feedback**:

- focus on the strengths / weakness of the visualization itself, not the person who created it
- balance positive and negative feedback, and start with the positives!
- stay objective when suggesting improvements (e.g. "This part might benefit from some clarity...")
- be specific (e.g. instead of saying, "This chart is confusing," point out exactly what is unclear or misleading)
- suggest actionable solutions and / or alternatives, rather than only problems or criticisms

**For receiving feedback**:

- receiving feedback can be stressful -- this is a very normal feeling!
- listen carefully without disrupting / defending yourself
- take notes, ask questions, and thank your feedback giver(s)
- evaluate your feedback objectively to decide what to keep / reject / modify

**For applying feedback:**

- prioritize feedback based on relevance, importance, and feasibility
- create a plan and a timeline to implement
- critically evaluate / compare your before and after versions
- seek new feedback!
