A crow wearing a party hat is perched on a welome sign the start of the bridge and says 'SQUAAWK YOU CAN DO IT!'. A green fuzzy monster with a party hat stands on the opposite end of the bridge, in front of the castle, with it's arms outstretched."

<!-- ### Pre-discussion Prep -->

<!-- [HW #3](../assignments/HW3.qmd) has you working on your visualizations for your [final project (HW #4)](../assignments/HW4.qmd). Please plan to bring the following to discussion: -->

<!-- - **one** of your three visualizations (i.e. one of the three required viz for [option 1](../assignments/HW4.qmd#option-1), *or* one of the three viz that will make up your infographic for [option 2](../assignments/HW4.qmd#option-1#option-2))   -->
<!-- - the question that you’re trying to answer with your visualization -->

<!-- Add your visualization and your question to the appropriate Google slide deck (each slide is labeled with a name) before section begins: -->

<!-- - [10am section slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sDdgujrlVPwy44YIlbhKj-tdENu1nzI_d9jOLM05Ptg/edit#slide=id.p) -->
<!-- - [11am section slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15B3Yn0QLdNlLdLSNwzmuqDkXACeBQKkZq_uWk2l7WHI/edit#slide=id.p) -->

<!-- The viz you bring should meet the [HW #3](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW3.html) requirements (see the section that begins with *"Mock up your visualizations using code..."*) -- this should be a well-constructed, carefully thought-through and polished plot (any one of the panels in the [Hollywood Age Gaps](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10tk6XawtK0GD-XU4VCkupTOBK4tFW0JamKUeufiqlL0/edit#slide=id.g2b861b4d8eb_0_63) visualization that you saw in discussion last week is a great example of the level of “polish” we’d expect to see). You should be prepared to discuss your design choices and receive constructive feedback from your peers. -->

<!-- ### How to give / receive feedback -->

<!-- Giving, receiving *and* implementing feedback is an important part of any creative process (including building data visualizations!). **There are two "levels" of feedback:** -->

<!-- - **high-level:** where the focus is on whether a data visualization is accurate, relevant and understandable for the intended audience -->
<!-- - **detail-oriented:** where the focus is on aesthetics choices (e.g. colors, typefaces, layout, themes, white space, etc.) and how those choices help to enhance / tell the story  -->
<!-- [**This week, you should focus largely on providing *high-level* feedback (though suggestions on how to tweak the details of a visualization are welcome).**]{.teal-text} -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip collapse=true} -->
<!-- ## Important tips for giving / receiving / implementing feedback (adapted from this [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-improve-your-data-visualizations-feedback)): -->

<!-- **For giving feedback**: -->

<!-- - focus on the strengths / weakness of the visualization itself, not the person who created it -->
<!-- - balance positive and negative feedback, and start with the positives!  -->
<!-- - stay objective when suggesting improvements (e.g. "This part might benefit from some clarity...")  -->
<!-- - suggest actionable solutions and / or alternatives, rather than only problems or criticisms  -->

<!-- **For receiving feedback**: -->

<!-- - receiving feedback can be stressful -- this is a very normal feeling! -->
<!-- - listen carefully without disrupting / defending yourself -->
<!-- - take notes, ask questions, and thank your feedback giver(s) -->
<!-- - evaluate your feedback objectively to decide what to keep / reject / modify -->

<!-- **For applying feedback:** -->

<!-- - prioritize feedback based on relevance, importance, and feasibility -->
<!-- - create a plan and a timeline to implement  -->
<!-- - critically evaluate / compare your before and after versions -->
<!-- - seek new feedback! -->
