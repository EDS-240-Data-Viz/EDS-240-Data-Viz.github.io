A green fuzzy monster with a party hat stands on the opposite end of the bridge, in front of the castle, with it's arms outstretched."

From here on out, we'll be using discussion sections to share drafts of final project data visualizations and receive feedback from peers. Please complete the following before coming to section:

### A. Prepare your data viz slide 

<!-- Add *one* of your draft data vizualizations to your slide -->

[HW #3](assignments/HW3.qmd){target="_blank"}, asks you to draft all three required visualizations for your chosen [final project (HW #4)](assignments/HW4.qmd){target="_blank"} option. Find your assigned slide from the correct Google Slide deck (see table, below) and add the following:

<!-- plan to bring the following to discussion: -->
<!-- (i.e. one of the three viz that will make up your infographic for [option 1](../assignments/HW4.qmd#option-1), *or* one of the three required viz for for [option 2](../assignments/HW4.qmd#option-1#option-2), *or*) -->

1. ***one*** of your three visualizations
2. the question that you're trying to answer with your visualization

<!-- Add your visualization and your question to the appropriate Google slide deck (each slide is labeled with a name) before section begins: -->

<!-- - [10am section slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sDdgujrlVPwy44YIlbhKj-tdENu1nzI_d9jOLM05Ptg/edit#slide=id.p) -->
<!-- - [11am section slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15B3Yn0QLdNlLdLSNwzmuqDkXACeBQKkZq_uWk2l7WHI/edit#slide=id.p) -->

The visualization you bring should meet the [HW #3](assignments/HW3.qmd){target="_blank"} requirements (see #6 under the [Description](assignments/HW3.qmd#description){target="_blank"} section) -- this should be a well-constructed, carefully thought-through and polished plot. You should be prepared to discuss your design choices and receive constructive feedback from your peers.

### B. Read up on how to give / receive feedback

Giving, receiving *and* implementing feedback is an important part of any creative process (including building data visualizations!). **There are two "levels" of feedback:**

- **high-level:** where the focus is on whether a data visualization is accurate, relevant and understandable for the intended audience
- **detail-oriented:** where the focus is on aesthetics choices (e.g. colors, typefaces, layout, themes, white space, etc.) and how those choices help to enhance / tell the story

[**This week, you should focus largely on providing *high-level* feedback (though suggestions on how to tweak the details of a visualization are welcome).**]{.teal-text}

## Important tips for giving / receiving / implementing feedback:

The following tips were adapted from this [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-improve-your-data-visualizations-feedback){target="_blank"}.

**For giving feedback**:

- focus on the strengths / weakness of the visualization itself, not the person who created it
- balance positive and negative feedback, and start with the positives!
- stay objective when suggesting improvements (e.g. "This part might benefit from some clarity...")
- suggest actionable solutions and / or alternatives, rather than only problems or criticisms

**For receiving feedback**:

- receiving feedback can be stressful -- this is a very normal feeling!
- listen carefully without disrupting / defending yourself
- take notes, ask questions, and thank your feedback giver(s)
- evaluate your feedback objectively to decide what to keep / reject / modify

**For applying feedback:**

- prioritize feedback based on relevance, importance, and feasibility
- create a plan and a timeline to implement
- critically evaluate / compare your before and after versions
- seek new feedback!
