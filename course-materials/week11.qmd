The coder’s arms and legs have ropes attached to two hot air balloons lifting them up, with labels on the balloons including 'teachers', 'bloggers', 'friends', 'developers'. Below the code hero, several people carry a trampoline with labels 'support' and 'community' that will catch them if they fall."

<!-- PRACTICE PRESENTATIONS WITH PARTNERS -->

<!-- Let's celebrate all of our hard work with a data visualization showcase! Everyone will have ~2 minutes to show off their creations. Please add your three data visualizations (option 1) or infographic (option 2) to your assigned slide (linked below) and come prepared to *briefly* describe the following: -->

<!-- 1. Describe your data and where you found it -->
<!-- 2. What question(s) did you set out to answer? -->
<!-- 3. One thing that you're super proud of figuring out / creating -->
<!-- 4. One thing that you wanted to implement but couldn't quite make happen (yet) -->

<!-- Find your slide here: -->
