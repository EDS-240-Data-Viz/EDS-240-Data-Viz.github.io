The coder’s arms and legs have ropes attached to two hot air balloons lifting them up, with labels on the balloons including 'teachers', 'bloggers', 'friends', 'developers'. Below the code hero, several people carry a trampoline with labels 'support' and 'community' that will catch them if they fall."
