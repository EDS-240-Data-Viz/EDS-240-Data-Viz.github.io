## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-lecture Prep {#pre-class-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # a package containing the `penguins` data set, which we'll use for plotting practice
install.packages("tidyverse") # a collection of packages used for data wrangling / manipulation and visualization (including {ggplot2})
```

### B. Create your `EDS-240-class-examples` repository

We'll be coding together quite a bit throughout this course. To stay organized, we'll complete all of our in-class examples in one repository (repo). **Create and clone a GitHub repository named `EDS-240-class-examples`** (or something that makes sense for you). Step-by-step instructions are provided, below, if needed:

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}
## Step-by-step instructions for creating and cloning a GitHub repo:
**Create a remote (GitHub) repo:**

1. Navigate to your GitHub profile and click on **Repositories** (top menu bar)
2. Click on the green **New** button in the upper right-hand corner
3. Give it the name `EDS-240-class-examples`, and optionally, a short description. Select the radio button for **Public** repository (it should be selected by default). **Initialize this repository with a README** by checking the box *and* **Add a .gitignore** (select **R** from the **.gitignore template** drop down menu) boxes. Click **Create repository**.
4. From your repo's main page, click the green **Code** button and copy the URL to your clipboard

**Clone your repo:**

5. Open up RStudio
6. Click on the drop down menu next to the R project icon (top right corner)
7. Click **New Project...** > **Version Control** > **Git** > paste your repo's URL in the **Repository URL:** box and press **Tab** to auto fill the **Project directory name** field (it should automatically be named the same as your GitHub repo). **Browse** to select where on your computer you'd like your repo to be saved.
8. Click **Create Project**
:::

**You should also create a folder for each week (e.g. `week1/`, `week2/`, `week3/`, etc.)** inside your repository's root directory to help keep all the various files that we'll download / create organized. This consistent naming scheme will also make it easy to add large files (e.g. data files) to your `.gitignore` (you'll do this for the first time in this week's pre-discussion prep).

### C. Download today's `.qmd` template

Template `.qmd` files will be provided alongside (most) lecture slides to help keep us organized and on track throughout class. They are available for download directly from GitHub at the link(s) provided in the Lecture Materials table (below). Look for the download button at the top right corner of the file (it looks similar to this, {{< fa download title="a downward pointing arrow atop a hard drive" >}}). Please download all necessary templates and save them to the appropriate `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/weekX` folder before each class.

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-discussion Prep {#pre-discussion-prep} 

Today's discussion will **focus on data cleaning / wrangling**. Before coming to section, you'll need to install some packages and download data. Find step-by-step instructions in the note, below (collapsed to save space):

### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("here") # for reproducible, relative file paths
install.packages("janitor") # tools for cleaning dirty data
install.packages("usdata") # demographic data on the United States at the county and state levels spanning multiple years.
```

### B. Download necessary data

[Download the data (`fracking.csv`)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vR0Ppc8YaIsHmAOluxeOtmKu1DG_WaR9/view?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"} from Google Drive and save it to your class repo in the following location: `EDS-240-class-examples/week1/data/fracking.csv` (NOTE: data were originally downloaded as a zip file from [FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/data-download){target="_blank"} in November 2023. Since then, FracFocus has published a cleaner version of these data, which defeats some of this purpose of this exercise. As such, we'll be working with this saved version of the data, rather than downloading directly from FracFocus's data download page.)

### C. Add data to `.gitignore`

We don't want to push any data in our repo to GitHub (GitHub enforces file size limits, and you'll run into some serious headaches when you try to push a file that's too big) -- to avoid doing this, we can add our data files to our `.gitignore` file, which, as the name implies, is a collection of files that we want Git to ignore. **Open up your `.gitignore` file and add the following line (anywhere is fine, but it makes sense to add it beneath the last line):**

```{bash filename=".gitignore"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
# ignore any folder named `data/` within folders named `week__` (* acts as a wildcard)
/week*/data/
```

Notice that when you **Save** your modified `.gitignore` file, untracked data files at the specified file path disappear from your Git tab in RStudio, and a modified `.gitignore` file appears in it's place (this is what we want!). Stage / add, commit, and push `.gitignore`.

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
## A gif of this whole process (in case it's helpful!)
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gitignore.gif"))
```

::: {.center-text .gray-text}
An example repo with three folders: `week1/`, `week2/`, and `other-stuff/`. Each of those folders has a subfolder named `data/`, and each `data/` folder contains a `.csv` file. Adding the line, `/week*/data/` to the `.gitignore` tells Git to ignore folders (and their contents) named `data/` that are within a parent folder named `week__` (the `*` acts as a wildcard). If we wanted to ignore all three `data/` folders (including `other-stuff/data/`), we can instead include `/*/data/` to our `.gitignore`.

### D. Prepare a `week1-discussion.qmd` file

Add a new blank file to your class repo -- you'll complete your discussion exercises here. For organization's sake, it should live in the following location: `EDS-240-class-examples/week1/week1-discussion.qmd`. Fill out the necessary YAML information (`title`, `author`, `date` + any other information you find helpful).
