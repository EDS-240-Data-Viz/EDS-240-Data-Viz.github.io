### A. Install required packages {#install-pkgs}

```{r install-pkgs-lecture}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # a package containing the `penguins` data set, which we'll use for plotting practice
install.packages("tidyverse") # a collection of packages used for data wrangling / manipulation and visualization (including {ggplot2})
install.packages("patchwork") # makes it super easy to combine individual plots into a single graphic
```

### B. Create & organize your `EDS-240-class-examples` repository {#create-class-repo}

We'll be coding together quite a bit throughout this course. To stay organized, we'll complete all of our in-class examples in one repository (repo). Setup your repository following these steps:

1. **Create and clone a GitHub repository named `EDS-240-class-examples`** (or something that makes sense for you). Step-by-step instructions are provided, below, if needed:

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}
## Step-by-step instructions for creating and cloning a GitHub repo:
**Create a remote (GitHub) repo:**

1. Navigate to your GitHub profile and click on **Repositories** (top menu bar)
2. Click on the green **New** button in the upper right-hand corner
3. Give it the name `EDS-240-class-examples`, and optionally, a short description. Select the radio button for **Public** repository (it should be selected by default). **Initialize this repository with a README**, then click **Create repository**.
4. From your repo's main page, click the green **Code** button and copy the URL to your clipboard

**Clone your repo:**

*You may choose the IDE of your choice, though the instructions below describe a workflow for RStudio users.*

5. Open up RStudio
6. Click on the drop down menu next to the R project icon (top right corner)
7. Click **New Project...** > **Version Control** > **Git** > paste your repo's URL in the **Repository URL:** box and press **Tab** to auto fill the **Project directory name** field (it should automatically be named the same as your GitHub repo). **Browse** to select where on your computer you'd like your repo to be saved.
8. Click **Create Project**
:::

2. **Create a folder for each week (e.g. `week1/`, `week2/`, `week3/`, etc.)** inside your repository's root directory to help keep all the various files that we'll download / create organized. This consistent naming scheme will also make it easy to add large files (e.g. data files) to your `.gitignore` file, which is automatically created when you clone your repo.

3. **Update your `.gitignore` file** to prevent yourself from accidentally committing data files ([GitHub limits the size of files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github){target="_blank"} allowed in repos). Open your `.gitignore` file and add the following:

```{r ignore-data}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# ignore any folder named `data/` within folders named `week*` (* acts as a wildcard)
/week*/data/
```

4. **Fill out your repo's README,** referencing the [MEDS README Guidelines](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/README-guidelines/){target="_blank"}.

### C. Download the `.qmd` template {#download-templates}

Template `.qmd` files will be provided alongside (most) lecture slides to help keep us organized and on track throughout class. They are available for download directly [from GitHub](https://github.com/EDS-240-Data-Viz/code-along-templates/tree/main){target="_blank"} at the link(s) provided in the **Lecture Materials** table (below). Look for the download button at the top right corner of the file (it looks similar to this, {{< fa download title="a downward pointing arrow atop a hard drive" >}}). Please download all necessary templates and save them to the appropriate `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/weekX` folder before each class.

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-lab Prep {#pre-lab-prep} 

### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("here") # for reproducible, relative file paths
install.packages("janitor") # tools for cleaning dirty data
```

### B. Download the data {#download-data}

Save data to your class repo at `EDS-240-class-examples/week1/data/`:

| Dataset title | Download link | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| HoneyBee Colonies | Download from [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T4cOrd6Fyyq-iep6Jg_6sFjmO-yYX1oK/view?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"} |While the original bee stressor data come from the [USDA](https://esmis.nal.usda.gov/publication/honey-bee-colonies), we will be using a compiled version of this data that come from the TidyTuesday organization, found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2022/2022-01-11). In order to achieve the goal of data wrangling in this week's lab, the data from TidyTuesday was 'messified' using the`{messy}` and `{tidyverse}` package in R. |

### C. Add data to `.gitignore`

We don't want to push any data in our repo to GitHub (GitHub enforces file size limits, and you'll run into some serious headaches when you try to push a file that's too big). To avoid doing this, we can add our data files to our `.gitignore` file, which, as the name implies, is a collection of files that we want Git to ignore. **Open up your `.gitignore` file and add the following line (anywhere is fine, but it makes sense to add it beneath the last line):**

```{bash filename=".gitignore"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
# ignore any folder named `data/` within folders named `week__` (* acts as a wildcard)
/week*/data/
```

Notice that when you **Save** your modified `.gitignore` file, untracked data files at the specified file path disappear from your Git tab in RStudio, and a modified `.gitignore` file appears in it's place (this is what we want!). Stage / add, commit, and push `.gitignore`.

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
## A gif of this whole process (in case it's helpful!)
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gitignore.gif"))
```

::: {.center-text .gray-text}
An example repo with three folders: `week1/`, `week2/`, and `other-stuff/`. Each of those folders has a subfolder named `data/`, and each `data/` folder contains a `.csv` file. Adding the line, `/week*/data/` to the `.gitignore` tells Git to ignore folders (and their contents) named `data/` that are within a parent folder named `week__` (the `*` acts as a wildcard). If we wanted to ignore all three `data/` folders (including `other-stuff/data/`), we can instead include `/*/data/` to our `.gitignore`.

### D. Prepare a `week1-lab.qmd` file

Add a new blank file to your class repo -- you'll complete your lab exercises here. For organization's sake, it should live in the following location: `EDS-240-class-examples/week1/week1-lab.qmd`. Fill out the necessary YAML information (`title`, `author`, `date` + any other information you find helpful).
