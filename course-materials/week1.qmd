## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("palmerpenguins") # a package containing the `penguins` data set, which we'll use for plotting practice
install.packages("tidyverse") # a collection of packages used for data wrangling / manipulation and visualization (including {ggplot2})
```

### B. Create your `EDS-240-class-examples` repository

We'll be coding together quite a bit throughout this course. To stay organized, we'll complete all of our in-class examples in one repository (repo). **Create and clone a GitHub repository named `EDS-240-class-examples`**. For step-by-step instructions, unfold the following note (collapsed to save space):

## Step-by-step instructions for creating and cloning a GitHub repo:
**Create a remote (GitHub) repo:**

1. Navigate to your GitHub profile and click on **Repositories** (top menu bar)
2. Click on the green **New** button in the upper right-hand corner
3. Give it the name `EDS-240-class-examples`, and optionally, a short description. Select the radio button for **Public** repository (it should be selected by default). **Initialize this repository with a README** by checking the box *and* **Add a .gitignore** (select **R** from the **.gitignore template** drop down menu) boxes. Click **Create repository**.
4. From your repo's main page, click the green **Code** button and copy the URL to your clipboard

**Clone your repo:**

5. Open up RStudio
6. Click on the drop down menu next to the R project icon (top right corner)
7. Click **New Project...** > **Version Control** > **Git** > paste your repo's URL in the **Repository URL:** box and press **Tab** to auto fill the **Project directory name** field (it should automatically be named the same as your GitHub repo). **Browse** to select where on your computer you'd like your repo to be saved.
8. Click **Create Project**

### Pre-discussion Prep

Before coming to section, you'll need to install some packages and download data. For step-by-step instructions, unfold the following note (collapsed to save space):

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=true}
## Step-by-step pre-discussion prep instructions
1. Install the following packages:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("janitor") # tools for cleaning dirty data
install.packages("usdata") # demographic data on the United States at the county and state levels spanning multiple years.
```

2. [Download the data (`fracking.csv`)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vR0Ppc8YaIsHmAOluxeOtmKu1DG_WaR9/view?usp=drive_link) from Google Drive and save it to your class repo in the following location: `EDS-240-class-examples/week1/data/fracking.csv` (NOTE: data were originally downloaded as a zip file from [FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/data-download) in November 2023. Since then, FracFocus has published a cleaner version of these data, which defeats some of this purpose of this exercise. As such, we'll be working with this saved version of the data, rather than downloading directly from FracFocus's data download page.)
3. We don't want to push any data in our repo to GitHub (GitHub enforces file size limits, and you'll run into some serious headaches when you try to push a file that's too big) -- to avoid doing this, we can add our data files to our `.gitignore` file, which, as the name implies, is a collection of files that we want Git to ignore. **Open up your `.gitignore` file and add the following line (anywhere is fine, but it makes sense to add it beneath the last line):**

```{bash filename=".gitignore"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
# ignore any folder named `data/` within folders named `week__` (* acts as a wildcard)
/week*/data/
```

Notice that when you **Save** your modified `.gitignore` file, untracked data files at the specified file path disappear from your Git tab in RStudio, and a modified `.gitignore` file appears in it's place (this is what we want!). Stage/add, commit, and push `.gitignore`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gitignore.gif"))
```

::: {.center-text .gray-text}
An example repo with three folders: `week1/`, `week2/`, and `other-stuff/`. Each of those folders has a subfolder named `data/`, and each `data/` folder contains a `.csv` file. Adding the line, `/week*/data/` to the `.gitignore` tells Git to ignore folders (and their contents) named `data/` that are within a parent folder named `week__` (the `*` acts as a wildcard). If we wanted to ignore all three `data/` folders (including `other-stuff/data/`), we can instead include `/*/data/` to our `.gitignore`.

### Background

By now, you may have heard / read something like, "Data scientists spend 80% of their time preparing their data for analysis and / or visualization." And while that may not be totally accurate for all data scientists or all projects, you *will* spend lots of time wrestling with data. [**You'll spend this week's discussion cleaning up a messy data set on hydraulic fracturing (aka [fracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking)), with the goal of (re)familiarizing yourselves with some of commonly-used tidyverse functions.**]{.teal-text}

This week's data comes courtesy of Jeremy Singer-Vine's [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) weekly newsletter of useful / curious data sets (the [2023.09.27 edition](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2023-09-27-edition/)). Singer-Vine's description:

> Since [launching in 2011](https://www.fracfocus.org/learn/about-fracfocus), [FracFocus](https://fracfocus.org/) has become the largest registry of [hydraulic fracturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking) chemical disclosures in the US. The database, available to explore online and [download in bulk](https://fracfocus.org/data-download), contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job, plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is [managed](https://fracfocus.org/about-us) by the [Ground Water Protection Council](https://www.gwpc.org/overview/), “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of state ground water regulatory agencies”. As seen in: The latest [installment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/25/climate/fracking-oil-gas-wells-water.html) of the New York Times’ [Uncharted Water series](https://www.nytimes.com/series/uncharted-waters).

### Solution 

You'll get the most out of discussion section if you physically type out the code yourself (rather than copying / pasting)!

***Note:** Some of the wrangling in the solution (collapsed, below) may seem a bit superfluous -- we've included lots of steps to (re)introduce as many of the common wrangling functions as possible, given our data set.*
