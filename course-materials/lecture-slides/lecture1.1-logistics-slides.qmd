Applying for DSP accommodations is a multi-step process and students should begin this as soon as possible as it can take 10 days to process applications. 

Step 1: Submit an application with DSP, upload documentation and select the services needed. 

Step 2: For exam accommodations (more time, private setting, etc.) students need to submit a proctor request for each exam in each course that they need accommodations for. DSP has instructions on their [website](https://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/) for completing these tasks and students can login to the DSP portal to check the status of their application and requests.
