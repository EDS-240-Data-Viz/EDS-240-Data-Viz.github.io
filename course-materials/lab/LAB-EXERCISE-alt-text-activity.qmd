::: {.callout-note}
It's up to you to organize your own `week3-lab.qmd` file (i.e. there is no template). You may (should) discuss and work through today's exercise with a partner (or two!).
:::

## Example 1: `{palmerpenguins}` ggplot

1. Copy the following code into your `week3-lab.qmd` file and add code chunk options that:
    - render the output (i.e. plot), but not the code
    - suppress any warnings or messages
2. Add alt text using the `fig-alt:` code chunk option
3. "Inspect" your plot (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| output: false
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```
