## {#what-is-data-wrangling data-menu-title="What is data wrangling?"}

[What do we mean by "data wrangling?"]{.slide-title}

<hr>

>*"Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is **the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format** with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics."*

::: {.right-align-text}
-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)
:::

. . . 

[Wrangling includes (but is not limited to):]{.body-text-m}

- **data cleaning** (e.g. handling missing values, consistent naming of observations, ensuring variables are the correct data types, etc.)
- **restructuring data** (e.g. tidying data (i.e. convert from wide > long format))
- **combining data sets** (e.g. using key values to merge two related data sets)

. . . 

[Wrangling is a critical first step in building any sort of data visualization!]{.body-text-m}

You may have heard something like, "Data scientists spend 80% of their time preparing their data for analysis and / or visualization." And while that may not be totally accurate for all data scientists or all projects, you *will* spend lots of time wrestling with data.

[`{ggplot2}` plays best with *tidy* data]{.slide-title}

#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-alt: "Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads 'Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.' On the left reads 'In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.' There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure."

**Reminder:** tidy data is not a `{ggplot2}`-specific concept. It's a broadly standardized way of organizing data.

## {#tidyverse data-menu-title="Tidyverse"}

[The `{tidyverse}` provides lots of helpful tools]{.slide-title2}

::: {.center-text .body-text-s}
The data science workflow, as described by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund in [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro), with added [`{tidyverse}` packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) as they fit within this workflow.

**Note** that there are a number of other non-tidyverse packages that are also incredibly helpful too (e.g. `{janitor}`, `{naniar}`)!

## {#messy-data data-menu-title="FracFocus' messy data"}

[Download bee stressor data from Google Drive!]{.slide-title}

**You should already have downloaded these data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T4cOrd6Fyyq-iep6Jg_6sFjmO-yYX1oK/view?usp=drive_link)**
:::

This data is available in a yearly report from the USDA. TidyTuesday processed this data into a csv in 2021. To achieve the goal of practicing data wrangling in this lab, this data was messified using the `messy` package in R, along with some `{tidyverse}` functions.
