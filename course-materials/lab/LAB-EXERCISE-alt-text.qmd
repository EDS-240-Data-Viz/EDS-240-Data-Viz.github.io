::: {.callout-note}
It's up to you to organize your own `week3-lab.qmd` file (i.e. there is no template). 
:::




Today you'll be practicing writing alt text with a partner by following the steps below:

#### Setup:

1. Find a partner and decide who will be Partner 1 and Partner 2
2. If you are Partner #1, copy the [Partner #1 code chunk](#partner-1) below into your qmd. If you are Partner #2, copy the [Partner #2 code chunk](#partner-2) below into your qmd. 

Keep your screen private from your partner throughout the activity!

#### Create Alt Text:
3. Individually, run your code chunk and view the plot it produces
4. On your piece of paper, write alt text that describes your plot
5. Once you're finished, close your laptop

#### Test the Alt Text:
6. Exchange papers with your partner
7. Read your partner's alt text and draw the data visualization they described based solely on their written description

#### Reflect and Revise:
9. Open your laptops and compare the drawings to the original plots
10. Discuss with your partner:

- How similar is the drawing to the actual plot?
- What key information was missing or unclear in the alt text?
- What details were most helpful for recreating the visualization?


Based on this feedback, revise your alt text to make it more complete and accurate.


#### Adding alt text to the plot. 
Now that you have revised your alt text, it is time to embed it in your plot! 

11. Add alt text using the `fig-alt:` code chunk option
12. Render your qmd file to html
13. "Inspect" your plot (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML



## Partner 1

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| output: false
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```




## Partner 2


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| output: false

#install.packages("lterdatasampler")
library(lterdatasampler)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

pie_crab %>%

  ggplot(aes(y=latitude, x = size, group = latitude)) +

  geom_boxplot() +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 7, to = 23, by = 2), limits = c(6.5,24))+

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 29, to = 43, by = 2), limits = c(29, 43.5)) +

  labs(title = "Crab carapace size (mm) by latitude")
```
## More alt text Examples

### Example 1 (from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/learning/lesson-plans/teach-about-climate-change-with-30-graphs-from-the-new-york-times.html){target="_blank"}):

1. Download this viz (right click > Save Image As... > save to your class repo)
2. Embed the viz in `week3-lab.qmd` using Markdown syntax *and* add alt text:

```{md}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
![](file/path/to/your/image){fig-alt="Alt text goes here"}
```

3. "Inspect" your image (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML 

::: {.callout-note}
This graphic form is called a [**dot plot**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)){target="_blank"}. 

Dot plots are particularly useful for visualizing variability within a single measured numerical variable -- here, that's how much temperature deviates from the 20th-century average for each month in a given year. Year is treated as a categorical variable.

It's easy to confuse dot plots with scatter plots, which alternatively are used to visualize a relationship between two (or sometimes three) numeric variables.

## Example 2 (Fig 1A from [Chapman et al. 2024](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh8874){target="_blank"}):

1. Download this viz (right click > Save Image As... > save to your class repo)
2. Embed the viz in `week3-lab.qmd` using HTML syntax *and* add alt text (you'll also need to include the `width` attribute to make the image a bit smaller):

```{html}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
<img src="file/path/to/image" alt="Alt text goes here" width="700px">
```

3. "Inspect" your image (right click > Inspect) to verify that the `alt` attribute and text is added to the HTML
