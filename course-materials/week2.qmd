## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

### A. Install required packages {#install-pkgs}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("usethis") # for editing .Renviron (see step C. in pre-class prep)
install.packages("chron") # for working with dates / times
install.packages("naniar") # tools for exploring & handing missing data
install.packages("tidytuesdayR") # used to download TidyTuesday data
install.packages("tidycensus") # an R package that allows users to interface with a select number of the US Census Bureau’s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames
install.packages("ggridges") # {ggplot2} extension for creating ridgeline plots
install.packages("gghighlight") # {ggplot2} extension for highlighting geoms
install.packages("ggbeeswarm") # {ggplot2} extension for creating categorical scatter (violin point) plots
install.packages("see") # {ggplot2} extension for model visualization (we'll be using it for it's geom, geom_violindot())

### C. Request a US Census Bureau API key & add it to your `.Renviron` file {#request-API-key}

1. To use the [`{tidycensus}` package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/){target="_blank} to access US Census Bureau data, you'll first need to **request and activate an API key**. Do so by following these steps:

    a. Request an API key at <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>{target="_blank}
    b. After a short period of time, you should receive an email with your key (it may be helpful to star / bookmark that email), and click the included link to activate your key (**Note:** if you get an error when activating your key, close your browser window and try clicking the activation link again).

2. **Add your API key to your `.Renviron` file**. For security purposes, you should *NEVER* push any API keys to GitHub. Rather than typing our API key into any of our scripts, we can instead save it to and read it from our `.Renviron` file. Follow these steps:

    a. Run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` in your Console, which will open up your `.Renviron` file (it will create it if you don't already have one).
    b. Store envrionment variables as key / value pairs. Add your API key as shown, below, then save and restart R for your changes to take effect.
    
```{r filename=".Renviron"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
# be sure to name it exactly as written here (all caps) 
CENSUS_API_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

- **Note:** You may also consider storing your API key in a password manager for safe keeping (e.g. in case your computer decides to call a quits, is lost, etc.) 

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## What exactly is `.Renviron`?

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory){target="_blank"} (files which are preceded by a dot, `.`) are hidden files, which are broadly used to customize the behavior of programs. You may already be familiar with some dotfiles, such as `.gitconfig` and `.gitignore`.

**The `.Renviron` file is an R-specific dotfile, which is commonly used for (though not limited to) storing sensitive information, such as API keys.** It lives in your computer's home directory (e.g. `/Users/yourUserName` on macOS, or `C:/Users/yourUserName/Documents` on Windows), and is automatically sourced when an R session starts. When sourced, all stored variables (such as your API key) are made available to your R environment for you to use. Variables should be stored as key / value pairs (e.g. `KEY_NAME="VALUE"`. Access them using `Sys.getenv("KEY_NAME")`.

Oftentimes, packages that are built to interface with APIs will include their own helper functions for adding API keys to your `.Renviron` file (e.g. see [`tidycensus::census_api_key()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/census_api_key.html){target="_blank"}). You may choose to use these helper functions in place of `usethis::edit_r_environ()`, if you prefer.

### D. Download `.qmd` templates & review initial data wrangling code {#download-templates}

1. Download all necessary templates (links in the table below) and save them to a `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/week2/` folder. 

2. Review the data wrangling code under the `## Setup` section of each template file and make note of any questions you might have. Due to time constraints, we won't be live-coding our way through the data wrangling code in class. However, we'll reserve some time to answer any questions before we jump into data viz {{< fa face-smile title="a smiling face" >}}.

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-discussion Prep {#pre-discussion-prep} 
### A. Prepare a `week2-discussion.qmd` file

Add a new blank file to your class repo at the following location: `EDS-240-class-examples/week2/week2-discussion.qmd.` Fill out the necessary YAML information (title, author, date + any other information you find helpful).

### B. (OPTIONAL) Install Chrome extension for picking colors

Install the [ColorZilla](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp){target="_blank"} Google Chrome extension (also available for [Firefox](https://www.colorzilla.com/firefox/){target="_blank"}), which makes it easy to select color values from webpages.
