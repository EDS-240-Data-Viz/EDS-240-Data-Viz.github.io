## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

Please be sure to complete the following before class: 

### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("usethis") # for editing .Renviron (see step C. in pre-class prep)
install.packages("chron") # for working with dates / times
install.packages("naniar") # tools for exploring & handing missing data
install.packages("tidytuesdayR") # used to download TidyTuesday data
install.packages("tidycensus") # an R package that allows users to interface with a select number of the US Census Bureauâ€™s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames
install.packages("ggridges") # {ggplot2} extension for creating ridgeline plots
install.packages("gghighlight") # {ggplot2} extension for highlighting geoms
install.packages("ggbeeswarm") # {ggplot2} extension for creating categorical scatter (violin point) plots
install.packages("see") # {ggplot2} extension for model visualization (we'll be using it for it's geom, geom_violindot())
install.packages("scales") # provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2, and gives you tools to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and palettes (installed automatically with {ggplot2} or {tidyverse})
```

### B. Download data

- **Lyme Disease Cases by State or Locality ([download link](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/case-counts/Lyme_Disease_Cases_by_State_or_Locality.csv))**, made available by the CDC (read more on the CDC's [Lyme Disease Surveillance Data page](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/surveillance-data-1.html){target="_blank"}; see other available data under the "Dashboard data files" section)
  - save the downloaded data (`Lyme_Disease_Cases_by_State_or_Locality.csv`) to your class repo at the file path: `EDS-240-class-examples/week2/data/Lyme_Disease_Cases_by_State_or_Locality.csv`

### C. Request a US Census Bureau API key

1. To use the [`{tidycensus}` package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/){target="_blank} to access US Census Bureau data, you'll first need to **request and activate an API key**. Do so by following these steps:

    a. Request an API key at <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>{target="_blank}
    b. After a short period of time, you should receive an email with your key (it may be helpful to star / bookmark that email), and click the included link to activate your key (**Note:** if you get an error when activating your key, close your browser window and try clicking the activation link again)

2. **Add your API key to your `.Renviron` file**. For security purposes, you should *NEVER* push any API keys to GitHub. Rather than typing our API key into any of our scripts, we can instead save it to our `.Renviron` file. Follow these steps:

    a. Run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` in your Console, which will open up your `.Renviron` file (it will create it if you don't already have one)
    b. Store envrionment variables as key / value pairs. Add your API key as shown, below, then save and restart R for your changes to take effect.
    
```{r filename=".Renviron"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
censusKEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
    
::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## What is `.Renviron`?

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory){target="_blank"} are hidden files (preceded by a dot, `.`), which are broadly used to customize the behavior of programs. You may already be familiar with some dotfiles, such as other `.gitconfig` and `.gitignore`.

**The `.Renviron` file is an R-specific dotfile, which is commonly used for (though not limited to) storing sensitive information, such as API keys.** It lives in your computer's home directory (e.g. `/Users/yourUserName` on macOS, or `C:/Users/yourUserName/Documents` on Windows), and is automatically sourced when an R session starts. When sourced, all stored variables (such as your API key) are made available to your R environment for you to use.
:::
    
<!-- To prevent us from accidentally pushing our key(s), we can save it to a separate file which we'll add to our `.gitignore`. Do so by following these steps: -->

<!--   a. Create a `week2/` folder in the root directory of your class repo -->

<!--   b. Add a file to your `week2/` folder called `KEYS.R`, and save your API key to an object name like this: -->

<!-- ```{r filename="~/week2/KEYS.R"} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- censusKEY <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--   b. Add `KEYS.R` to your `.gitignore` -->

<!-- ```{r filename=".gitignore"} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- /week2/KEYS.R -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--   c. Save `.gitignore` (once saved, you should see the newly added `KEYS.R` file disappear from your **Git** pane in RStudio, and a modified `.gitignore` appear). Stage/add, commit, and push this `.gitignore` file to GitHub -->

<!-- In class, we'll source our key (by running `source(here::here("week2", "KEYS.R"))`) into any scripts / Qmd files, where required.  -->

### C. Download `.qmd` templates & review initial data wrangling code

::: {.callout-important}
## TODO

add more instructions about data wrangling review
:::

Download all necessary templates (links in the table below) and save them to a `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/week2` folder.

## Discussion Materials

*Coming soon!*

<!-- ### Pre-discussion Prep -->

<!-- **Before coming to section, please be sure to:** -->

<!-- 1. Install the following packages: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- #| code-line-numbers: false -->
<!-- install.packages("geofacet") # facet data for different geographical regions using panels arranged in shapes that mimic geographic topology -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- 2. **(Optional)** Install the [ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) Google Chrome extension, which makes it easy to select color values from webpages. -->

<!-- ### Background -->

<!-- The [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (USDM) is a collection of measures that allows experts to assess droughts in the United States. It is produced through a partnership between the [National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://drought.unl.edu/), the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/). You can download and explore comprehensive statistics through their [data portal](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx). -->

<!-- The [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) community wrangled and visualized USDM data back in 2021 ([2021-07-20, week 30](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md)), so we'll use the `{tidytuesdayR}` package to import some minimally-tidied data (TidyTuesday always provides the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md#cleaning-script) that the organizers used to pre-process any of the data provided -- these data comprise three separate data sets, which were converted from wide to long format, joined together, and had some columns renamed). -->

<!-- [**Over the course of the next two discussion sections (week 3 & week 4), you'll be recreating the following data visualization produced by U.S. Drought Monitor, which you can find on the [*Droughts in California* Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_in_California):**]{.teal-text} -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| eval: true -->
<!-- #| echo: false -->
<!-- #| fig-align: "center" -->
<!-- #| out-width: "75%" -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "usdm.png")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- [**This week, we'll focus on the data layer, geometric layer, and scales. Next week, we'll work on tweaking the theme (all non-data elements) to get it to look just like the U.S. Drought Monitor's version.**]{.teal-text} -->

<!-- ### Solution -->

<!-- You'll get the most out of discussion section if you physically type out the code yourself (rather than copying / pasting)! -->
