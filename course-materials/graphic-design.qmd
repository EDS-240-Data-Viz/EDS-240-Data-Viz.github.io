**This workshop will focus primarily on using Affinity Designer for infographic design.** We'll see various examples of work created using Canva and Google Docs, though we won't spend much time learning these tools. They *are* awesome (and free) alternatives to Affinity, so you may decide to explore these more on your own time.

### A. Download / install your *free* Affinity V2 Designer Trial

The Affinity team was kind enough to provide us with 40(!) extended Affinity V2 app licenses, which are valid now until March 31, 2025. Follow [these installation instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1atPlULR0zttKtwRcw2CcKUYfKH9BLMtC2nHArbSUE5c/edit?tab=t.0){target="_blank"} ahead of class. 

Affinity is a subscription-free product -- if you are interested in purchasing it after your trial ends, visit [their website](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/affinity-pricing/){target="_blank"}.

### B. *(Optional)* Create a *free* Canva account

Visit [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/free/){target="_blank"} to get started.
