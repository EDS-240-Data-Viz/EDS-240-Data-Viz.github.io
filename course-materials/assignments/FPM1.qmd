FPM #1 is the the first step in working towards your [final project](final-project.qmd){target="_blank"}, which is meant to combine nearly all of the course [learning outcomes](final-project.qmd#LOs){target="_blank"}. **This week, we'll be finding data and brainstorming questions.**
:::

## Description {#description}

### I. Review the final project instructions {#partI}

[**Begin by reading the [final project description](final-project.qmd){target="_blank"} in full**]{.teal-text} so that you have a clear understanding of the goals and requirements. 

### II. Find data and brainstorm questions {#partII}

Now that you have a better understanding of where we're headed, let's make a bit of progress towards that end goal. [**This week, you'll focus on finding data that interest you and begin brainstorming some questions that you might explore / answer using those data.**]{.teal-text} Your data set(s) may be related to a past project, or even your current Capstone or GP. It may also be a completely new data set(s), unrelated to anything you're currently working on. Consider checkout out these [data sources](../../resources.qmd#data-sources){target="_blank"} if you need some inspiration on where to start (you are *not* limited to just these data sources).

## Asking the right question is *critical* and also one of the most challenging steps

I highly recommend checking out the following resources before diving in:

- this short Substack piece by [Enrico Bertini](https://enrico.bertini.io/){target="_blank"}, titled [*Asking the right data questions and asking the data questions right*](https://filwd.substack.com/p/asking-the-right-data-questions-and){target="_blank"}, for some great insights on the challenges and approaches to discovering and revising your data question
- this TED talk titled, [The Power in Effective Data Storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e52QfQngrM){target="_blank"}, by [Malavica Sridhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malavica-sridhar/){target="_blank"} (~15 min; yes, I know the audio gets a little wonky part-way through {{< fa face-smile title="a smiling face" >}})

### III. Answer questions {#partIII}

[**Once you've found your data set(s), answer the following questions:**]{.teal-text}

- [ ] **1.** Describe your data set(s). Be sure to address the following:
    - [ ] **a.** Where did you find these data?
    - [ ] **b.** What variables do these data contain? Is there sufficient metadata for understanding what those variables are?
- [ ] **2.** What steps are involved in downloading or accessing the data (e.g. "I can download the data directly from this online portal (e.g. by clicking a button)," "I need to use an API to retrieve the data," "There's an R package with functions for accessing the API,"  "I collected these data myself from a past research project," etc.)?
- [ ] **3.** What question(s) do you hope to answer using these data (remember to read over Enrico Bertini's [article](https://filwd.substack.com/p/asking-the-right-data-questions-and){target="_blank"})? 
- [ ] **4.** Will you need to combine multiple data sets to successfully answer your question(s)? If so, have you found all the necessary data? Do you have a way to combine it (e.g. matching key values across all data sets)?

### IV. (OPTIONAL) Begin cleaning / wrangling your data

This will be a focus of [FPM #2](FPM2.qmd){target="_blank"}, but if you're excited to dive in or are looking to get ahead, you should certainly take this time to do so!

## *DO NOT* push large data files to GitHub
Take care to not push any large data files (>2GB) to GitHub. Instead, add your data file(s) or entire data folder to your `.gitignore`.
:::

## Rubric (specifications) {#specs}

You must complete the following, as detailed below, to receive a "Satisfactory" mark for FPM #1:

- [ ] **Create a GitHub repository named `yourLastName-eds240-infographic`.** This is where you'll be doing any / all work related to your final project. Be sure to make your repository public, initialize your repository with a `README`, and add a `.gitignore` file.
- [ ] **Create a [GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) with the title, `HW1 - finding data / initial brainstorming`, and address the following in that issue:**
    - [ ] Link to (or otherwise prove the existence of) at least one data set that you plan to use for your final project.
    - [ ] Answer all four Part III questions. There is no set length requirement, but you must answer each question in full to receive a Satisfactory score.
    - [ ] Ensure that your GitHub issue is neatly organized / formatted (you can use Markdown syntax here!).
    - [ ] Tag your instructors (**[@samanthacsik](https://github.com/samanthacsik){target="_blank"}** & **[@annieradams](https://github.com/annieradams){target="_blank"}**) somewhere in your issue (at the start or end may make the most sense) -- this will send us an email notification linking to your issue.
- [ ] **Add your repository's URL next to your name on [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eCGNK4Bl2QHXZ0ucs0wYegm1BiNo9RyI8r17DyrNgM4/edit?gid=0#gid=0){target="_blank"}** by 11:59pm on Wed 01/21/2026.
