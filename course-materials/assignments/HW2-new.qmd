Tips:
- load the `NRIDataDictionary.csv` for descriptions of all variable names
- can't see all columns when using View(); try names()
- American Community Survey (ACS) is an annual nationwide survey that collects and produces information on social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about the US population.

- The acs1 survey (1-year estimates) is only available for areas with populations of 65,000 or more. Census tracts generally do not meet this threshold. Instead, you should use the acs5 survey (5-year estimates), which provides data at the census tract level.
