## Learning Outcomes {#LOs}

- interpret code written by others 
- assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations

## Description {#description}

Much of your time as a data scientist will be spent looking at code written by others -- you may imagine scenarios such as trying to learn from and adapt someone else's code for your own work, conducting a code review for a colleague, or validating the code output of a generative AI tool. Being able to look at and make sense of code that you did not write yourself is an invaluable skill and an important one to practice throughout your learning journey. [**Here, you'll be asked to interpret data wrangling and `{ggplot2}` code written by someone else. This will likely require running code (both as a whole *and* line-by-line), as well as reading documentation, Googling and / or leveraging genAI tools to aid in your understanding.**]{.teal-text}
<!-- 
*I recognize that there is (likely) **a lot** of new code presented here that we haven't yet covered in this course (we'll get there eventually though!). This is intentionally an exercise is resourcefulness! By the end of this exercise, you should feel a bit more confident in your ability to interpret (and maybe even reuse) code written by others.* -->

### I. Create a repository using the `eds240-hw1-ufo` template {#partI}

[**Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template){target="_blank"} to create a repository from the [`eds240-hw1-ufo` template](https://github.com/EDS-240-Data-Viz/eds240-hw1-ufo){target="_blank"}.**]{.teal-text} The template repository includes `HW1.qmd`, which is where you'll be completing your work.

### II. Interpret code & answer questions {#partII}

[**Interpret, explain, and reflect on code adapted from [Dan Oehm](https://gradientdescending.com/#google_vignette){target="_blank"}'s *UFO Sightings* visualization, following the question prompts in `HW1.qmd`**]{.teal-text}. You can find metadata and additional information on the [rfordatascience/tidytuesday (2023-06-20) `readme.md`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/readme.md#data-dictionary){target="_blank"}. 

**Note:** While it's not required or graded, you are strongly encouraged to annotate this code (with the help of documentation, Google, genAI tools, etc.). There's a lot of creative and helpful code packed into this visualization (and the data wrangling leading up to the viz!), and you may find it helpful to revisit it throughout the quarter to reference particular sections or techniques.

## You'll be interpreting *refactored* code
Dan Oehm is the original visionary and creator of this epic TidyTuesday submission from 2023. The code you'll be annotating for this assignment is a *refactored* version of Dan's [original code](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2023/week-25-ufo/ufo.R){target="_blank"}, which was done to reorganize and clarify certain sections for the purpose of this assignment. **Refactoring** is the process of restructuring (e.g. reorganizing or rewriting) code while preserving its original functionality and output (e.g. the only visual differences in the outputs are the UFO image and plot caption, which were intentionally changed).

## Rubric (specifications) {#rubric}

To recieve a "Satisfactory" on HW #1:

- [ ] **Include your preferred name** in the `author` field of the `HW1.qmd` YAML. 
- [ ] **Answer all 24 questions** about the code and outputs correctly (though a few questions are opinion-based and do not have a single correct answer). There are no strict length requirements, however we expect that you answer them thoughtfully, fully, and in your own words.
- [ ] **Update your repo's README** so that it includes the core elements, as described in the [MEDS README Guidelines](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/README-guidelines/#always-include){target="_blank"}
- [ ] **Render `HW1.qmd` as a PDF.** Double check that all of your outputs, code, and prose are visible.
- [ ] **Upload your PDF to Gradescope** by 11:59pm on Wed 01/14/2026.
- [ ] **Submit a [Generative AI Statement of Use](https://forms.gle/uCw7U5jzJAKahjA4A){target="_blank}** for HW #1 by 11:59pm on Wed 01/14/2026.
