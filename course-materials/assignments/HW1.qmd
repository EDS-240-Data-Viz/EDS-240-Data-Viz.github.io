## Learning Outcomes {#LOs}

- read code written by others 
- assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations

## Description {#description}

Much of your time as a data scientist will be spent looking at code written by others -- you may imagine scenarios such as trying to learn from and adapt someone else's code for your own work, conducting a code review for a colleague, or validating the code output of a generative AI tool. Being able to look at and make sense of code that you did not write yourself is an invaluable skill and an important one to practice throughout your learning journey. [**Here, you'll be asked to interpret `{ggplot2}` code written by someone else. This will likely require running code (both as a whole *and* line-by-line), as well as reading documentation, Googling and / or leveraging genAI tools to aid in your understanding.**]{.teal-text}

*I recognize that there is (likely) **a lot** of new code presented here that we haven't yet covered in this course (we'll get there eventually though!). This is intentionally an exercise is resourcefulness! By the end of this exercise, you should feel a bit more confident in your ability to interpret (and maybe even reuse!) code written by others.*

### I. Create a repository using the `eds240-hw1-ufo` template

[**Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template){target="_blank"} to create a repository from the [`eds240-hw1-ufo` template](https://github.com/EDS-240-Data-Viz/eds240-hw1-ufo){target="_blank"}.**]{.teal-text} The template repository includes `HW1.qmd`, which is where you'll be completing your work.

### II. Interpret `{ggplot2}` code {#partII}

[**Annotate code adapted from [Dan Oehm](https://gradientdescending.com/#google_vignette){target="_blank"}'s *UFO Sightings* visualization ([original code](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2023/week-25-ufo/ufo.R){target="_blank"} & [original visualization](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2023/week-25-ufo/ufo.png){target="_blank"})**]{.teal-text}. You can find metadata and additional information about the data set on the [rfordatascience/tidytuesday (2023-06-20) `readme.md`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/readme.md#data-dictionary){target="_blank"}.

## You'll be annotating *refactored* code
Dan Oehm is the original visionary and creator of this epic TidyTuesday submission from 2023. The code you'll be annotating for this assignment is a *refactored* version of Dan's [original code](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2023/week-25-ufo/ufo.R){target="_blank"}. **Refactoring** is the process of restructuring (e.g. reorganizing or rewriting) code while preserving its original functionality / output (e.g. the only visual differences in the outputs are the UFO image and plot caption, which were intentionally changed).

# Tips: 
- Install the following packages (if you don't already have them): `{colorspace}`, `{geofacet}`, `{ggtext}`, `{glue}`, `{grid}`, `{magick}`, `{patchwork}`, `{scales}`, `{showtext}`, `{tidyverse}`
- The best (and really only) way to understand this code is to run it **line-by-line** -- for example, you might check out an original data frame > add in the first piped data wrangling function > check out the modified data frame > pipe in the next data wrangling function > check out the modified data frame again > and so on. You can approach "building up" the ggplot objects in a similar fashion. 
- You should leave the code chunk options, `#| eval: false` & `#| echo: true` set as-is. The final infographic is optimized (e.g. text sizes, spaces, etc.) to be saved / viewed as a PNG file, not as rendered in the RStudio Plots pane or embedded in a rendered Quarto document -- you may notice that the text in each individual ggplot looks wayyy too large when viewed in RStudio, but is appropriately-sized when saved as a PNG. We'll talk more about the complexities of saving ggplots in a later discussion section!
    - If you leave the above code chunk options in place, you should be able to successfully render the Quarto document so that it prints only the code and your annotations, along with your responses to the final (part 1b) questions.
- Some lines of code have already been annotated for you -- aim for this level of detail
- Pull up documentation for a function directly in RStudio's **Help** pane by running `?function_name` in the console. Vignettes and `pkgdown` sites are incredible resources as well (e.g. here is a [vignette](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/vignettes/patchwork.html){target="_blank"} and the [pkgdown](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/){target="_blank"} site for the `{patchwork}` package)
- If you don't immediately understand the purpose of a line / chunk of code, skip over it (temporarily) and continue working your way through the following code -- it oftentimes becomes more evident given additional context.
<!-- - Text will look *super* big and squished in the RStudio Viewer pane and Zoom window -- this is because text is sized so that it renders appropriately when the full infographic is saved as a PNG  -->
 - **Keep in mind:** ggplots are constructed in *layers* -- sometimes temporarily removing or rearranging layers can help clarify what's going on 
- Use RStudio's search bar (`Command` / `Ctrl` + `F`) to ensure that you've replaced all instances of `# ANNOTATE` with your own annotated description

### III. Answer questions {#partIII}

Once you're done annotating, respond to the following questions about this data visualization: 

- [ ] **1.** Consider the order of `geom_*()` layers in the US map plot (`plot_us`). Why did the original creator order the layers in this way?
- [ ] **2.** During week 2, we discuss [Choosing the right graphic form](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/lecture-slides/lecture2.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/title-slide). Refer to this lecture when answering the sub-questions, below:
    - [ ] **a.** What "perceptual tasks" (from Cleveland & McGill's hierarchy) must the viewer perform to extract information from these visualizations?
    - [ ] **b.** What task(s) do you think the author wanted to enable or message(s) he wanted to convey with these visualizations (see lecture 2.1, slide 16 for examples)? Be sure to note at least one task / message for each of the three data viz.
    - [ ] **c.** Name at least one caveat to the "hierarchy of perceptual tasks" that the author employed to achieve a goal(s) you noted in question b?
- [ ] **3.** Describe two elements of this piece that you find visually-pleasing / easy to understand / intuitive. Why? 
- [ ] **4.** Describe two elements of this piece that you feel could be better presented in a different way. Why? 
- [ ] **5.** Describe two new things that you learned by interpreting / annotating this code. These could be  packages, functions, or even code organizational approaches that you hadn't previously known about or considered.

## Rubric (specifications) {#hw1-p1-specs}

To recieve a "Satisfactory" on HW #1:

- [ ] Include your preferred name in the `author` field of the `Part1.qmd` YAML. 
- [ ] Update each comment line in the code that reads, `# ANNOTATE`, with a *brief* description, written in your own words. Some lines that have already been annotated for you -- you do not need to re-write these annotations. You are **allowed up to five incorrect or missing annotations**.
- [ ] Leave the code chunk options set to `eval: false` and `echo: true`, which ensures that your code renders, but the output(s) is suppressed. If you decide to break your code into smaller code chunks, ensure that each has the same options set. 
- [ ] Answer all Part B questions. Questions 1 and 2 have correct answers. Responses to questions 3-5 should be unique to you but answered in full. There is no set length requirement, and bullet points are acceptable.
- [ ] **Render `HW1.qmd` as a PDF.** Double check that all of your outputs, code, and prose are visible.
- [ ] **Upload your PDF to Gradescope** by 11:59pm on Wed 01/14/2026.
- [ ] **Submit a [Generative AI Statement of Use](https://forms.gle/uCw7U5jzJAKahjA4A){target="_blank}** for HW #1 by 11:59pm on Wed 01/14/2026.
