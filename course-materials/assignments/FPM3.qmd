FPM #3 is the the third step in working towards your [final project](final-project.qmd){target="_blank"}, which is meant to combine nearly all of the course [learning outcomes](final-project.qmd#LOs){target="_blank"}. **This week, you'll begin drafting the visualizations that will become part of your final infographic.**
:::

## Description {#description}

### I. Review the final project instructions {#partI}

[**Begin by reading the [final project description](final-project.qmd){target="_blank"} in full**]{.teal-text} to remind yourself of the goals and requirements. 

### II. Create `drafting-viz.qmd` {#partII}

[**Create an file named, `drafting-viz.qmd` within your `lastName-eds240-infographic` repo**]{.teal-text} and add appropriate YAML fields. You'll completing all sections of this assigment (Parts II-tbd) here.

### III. Some pre-planning {#partIII}

[**Before you start drafing your viz, answer the following questions:**]{.teal-text}

- [ ] **1.** Restate the questions you hope to answer with your inforgraphic. This should include *one overarching question* (think of this as driving the overall theme of your infographic) and *at least three subquestions* (each of which will be addressed by your infographic's component visualizations). Have these questions changed at all since FPM #1? If yes, how so? 

- [ ] **2.** Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer the above questions, and how.

::: {.callout-important}
## Important -- be specific here!
For example, let's say I'm interested in how Lyme disease incidence is changing over time for states X, Y and Z. An appropriate explanation of variables might look something like this: 

>*"I have two data sets, one containing population estimates by state from the `{tidycensus}` package, and another from the CDC containing lyme disease case counts by county and year. After wrangling / joining these data sets, I was able to calculate disease incidence as cases per 100k people at the state level. Doing so provides me with three variables to visualize: time (years), disease incidence (cases per 100k people), and state."*
:::

- [ ] **3.** In [FPM #2](FPM2.qmd){target="_blank"}, you created some exploratory data viz to better understand your data. You may already have some ideas of how you plan to formally visualize your data, but it's *incredibly* helpful to look at visualizations by other creators for inspiration. Find *at least two* data visualizations that you could (potentially) borrow / adapt pieces from. Download and embed them into your `drafting-viz.qmd` file, and explain which elements you might borrow (e.g. the graphic form, legend design, layout, etc.). 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Tip: Remember to check out the Resources page for lots of great inspiration!!
It lists tons of really wonderful websites, tutorials, and links to the repos / websites of some seriously incredible [data viz creators](../../resources.qmd#inspiration){target="_blank"}. This is an excellent place to start when looking for inspiration.

## Tip: Embedding images into a `.qmd` file

There are a number of ways to render an image in `.qmd` file. Two ways I find easiest are:

1. Using `knitr::include_graphics()` in a code chunk (if you're using R). Here are the chunk options I often specify:

```{{r}}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-alt: "Alt text here"
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image")
```

2. Using Markdown syntax:

`![](file/path/to/image){fig-alt="Alt text goes here"}`

### IV. Hand-draw your anticipated visualizations {#partIV}

[**Before you begin coding, it's a super useful practice to sketch out your anticipated visualizations by hand.**]{.teal-text} This [Medium article](https://medium.com/@tjanmichela/the-importance-of-sketching-in-data-visualization-78320c62e403){target="_blank"} does a great job summarizing why this step matters.

- [ ] Hand-draw your anticipated visualizations, then take a photo of your drawing(s) and embed it in your rendered `drafting-viz.qmd` file -- **note** that these are not *exploratory* visualizations, but rather your plan for your final visualizations that you will eventually polish and include in your infographic. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Open me for an example!

Here's a great example of some hand-sketched visualizations, by [Marine Kochuten](){target="_blank"} (MEDS 2025). Marina chose to also hand-draft a potential layout of her final infographic:
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/mkochuten-sketch.png")
```

And if you're curious how the final infographic turned out:
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/mkochuten-final.png")
```

### V. Recreate your hand-drawn visualizations using code {#partV}

[**Mock up *all* of your hand drawn visualizations using code.**]{.teal-text} We understand that you will continue to iterate on these into FPM #4 (particularly after receiving feedback), but by the end of FPM #3, you should:

  - [ ] have your data plotted (if you're experimenting with a graphic form(s) that was not explicitly covered in class, we understand that this may take some more time to build; you should have as much put together as possible)
  - [ ] use appropriate strategies to highlight / focus attention on a clear message
  - [ ] include appropriate text such as titles, captions, axis labels (**note:** you may eventually convert some text, such as titles and captions, into annotations or text elements on your infographic; it's still helpful to include titles, etc. on these stand-alone visualizations *now*, to provide your peer reviewers and instructional team with necessary context)
  - [ ] experiment with colors and typefaces / fonts
  - [ ] create a presentable / aesthetically-pleasing theme (e.g. (re)move gridlines / legends as appropriate, adjust font sizes, etc.)

### VI. Answer a few last questions about your work and progress

- [ ] **1.** What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R? If you struggled with mocking up any of your three visualizations, describe those challenges here.

- [ ] **2.** What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven't covered in class that you'll be learning how to use for your visualizations?

- [ ] **3.** What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?

## Rubric (specifications)

You must complete the following, as detailed below, to receive a "Satisfactory" mark for FPM #3:

::: {.callout-note}
## A few notes on expectations

- Your visulizations don't have to be perfect, but the message you want your viz to convey should be clear. If you're unable to figure out how to implement that successfully in code, be sure to describe in writing where you're headed.
- The more progress you make now, the more feedback we can provide ahead of FPM #4.
- There are no strict length requirements for the free-response questions above, however we expect that you answer them thoughtfully and fully. 
- Low-effort responses and visualizations will result in a "Not Yet" mark.
:::

- [ ] Complete all work in a file named, `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd`, which lives in your `lastName-eds240-HW4` repository -- you are welcome to draft / practice things in different files / scripts, but you must have all required elements of the assignment available in *this* file for us to reference and grade.
- [ ] Add any necessary YAML options (title, author, date, etc.). You must also include the following options:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
---
# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
---
```

- [ ] Ensure all code chunks have the correct options set so that **(a)** code *and* visualizations render, and **(b)** warnings and messages are suppressed (unless there is a reason to have them print). You should never print out entire data frames. *Please note that rendered documents that don't have appropriately specified chunk options will receive a "Not Yet" score.*
- [ ] Code should be appropriately styled and annotated (please see [this resource](../../clean-code-guide.qmd){target="_blank"} on the course website), and your `.qmd` file should be easy to navigate.
- [ ] Complete all exercises and answer all questions under the [Description section](HW3.qmd#description) above (use the check boxes to ensure you've completed all 7 required parts).
- [ ] Submit both an HTML *and* PDF version of your HW #3 via Gradscope by 11:59pm on Tue 02/25/2025 following these instructions:
    - [ ] **To submit your HTML file:** Render your `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd`, verify that you can open the resulting `HW3-drafting-viz.html` file in your browser and that all formatting looks good. Submit your HTML file to the Gradscope assignment titled, "Homework 3 - HTML"
    - [ ] **To submit your PDF file:** Convert your HTML to PDF by either **(a)** `Cmd / Ctrl` + `P` to Print > Save as PDF (easiest option), or **(b)** rendering your `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd` file directly to PDF. Submit your PDF file to Gradescope assignment titled, "Homework 3 - PDF"
        - [ ] ***IMPORTANT:** If you have folded code chunks, please be sure to unfold them before saving as a PDF (to ensure that all code is visible)*
