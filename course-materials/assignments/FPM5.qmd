### 3. Present your data viz product to the class {#part3-present}

<!-- [**Finally, you are expected to present your final data visualization product to the class.**]{.teal-text} -->

Final project flash talks will take place **in person during finals week**. You will have **3 minutes** to present your final data visualization(s). You may structure your presentation however you'd like, so long as you address the following: 

- [ ] the question(s) you set out to answer with this project / your visualization(s)
- [ ] your data source(s) and why those data are appropriate for answering your defined question(s)
- [ ] your intended audience
- [ ] two key insights from your visualization(s) -- these should focus on what your audience should take away from the data
- [ ] two to three design choices (e.g. colors, typography, graphic form, layout) that helped to shape the visualization(s) and improve communication for your intended audience
- [ ] one to two challenges that you encountered during this project, and how you addressed / iterated on these issues
- [ ] one to two things that you are especially proud of completing / learning / accomplishing for this project

The presentation format is flexible, but it should be something that can easily be shared with Sam and opened on her computer during the day of presentations.
