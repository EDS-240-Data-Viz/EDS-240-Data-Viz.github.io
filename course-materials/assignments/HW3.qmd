## Learning Outcomes {#p1-learning-outcomes}

- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience
- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that it's appropriately formatted for building data visualizations
- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing, visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically `{ggplot2}` + ggplot2 extension packages

## Description {#p1-description}

In class, we've been discussing strategies and considerations for choosing the right graphic form to represent your data and convey your intended message. Here, you'll apply what we're learning to natural hazards and demographics data, courtesy of the **[FEMA National Risk Index](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/){target="_blank"} (NRI)** and the **[US Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html){target="_blank"} (ACS)**.

## About the data

#### About FEMA's National Risk Index (NRI) for Natural Hazards

[FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/about/strategic-plan/about-fema){target="_blank"} (Federal Emergency Management Agency) is a government agency with a mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters. In 2021, FEMA launched the **[National Risk Index (NRI)](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/){target="_blank"}**, "a [dataset](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources){target="_blank"} and [online tool](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/map){target="_blank"} to help illustrate the United States communities most at risk for [18 natural hazards](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/natural-hazards){target="_blank"}".

**Risk** is defined as the potential for negative impacts resulting from natural hazards. It's calculated using the following equation (and illustrated in [this graphic](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/Content/Images/StaticPageImages/Risk_Index_Calculation.svg){target="_blank"}; read more about [determining risk](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/determining-risk){target="_blank"}):

$$Risk\:Index = Expected\:Annual\:Loss \times \frac{Social\:Vulnerability}{Community\:Resilience}$$

NRI provides hazard type-specific scores, as well as a composite score, which adds together the risk from all 18 hazard types. A community's **risk score** is represented by its percentile ranking among all other communities at the same level for Risk, Expected Annual Loss, Social Vulnerability and Community Resilience -- for example, if a given county's Risk Index percentile for a hazard type is 84.32 then its Risk Index value is greater than 84.32% of all US counties. Each community is also assigned a **risk rating**, which is a qualitative rating that describes the community in comparison to all other communities at the same level, ranging from “Very Low” to “Very High.”

You can learn more about the NRI at [hazards.fema.gov/nri](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/learn-more){target="_blank"}.

#### Accessing NRI Data

Data at the county- and census tract-level are available for download in multiple formats (including Shapefiles & CSVs) from NRI's [Data Resources page](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources){target="_blank"}.

### About the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS)

The **[American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html){target="_blank"}** is a nationwide, continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely social, economic, housing, and demographic data every year. Unlike the **Decennial Census** (which counts every person in the US every 10 years for the purpose of congressional appointment), the ACS collects detailed information from a small subset of the population (~3.5 million households) at 1- and 5-year intervals. Learn more about the [differences between these 1- and 5-year estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html){target="_blank"}.

#### Accessing ACS Data

The US Census Bureau provides a couple of tools for accessing their data, including: 

1. **[data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov){target="_blank"}:** a browser-based portal for exploring the many available [data tables](https://data.census.gov/table){target="_blank"} (e.g. [Table B02001](https://data.census.gov/table?q=B02001){target="_blank"}: Race)
2. **[The Census Data API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html){target="_blank"}:** a data service that enables software developers to access and use Census Bureau data within their applications

*However,* when working in R, the **[`{tidycensus}`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/){target="_blank"} package** is arguably the easiest way to query and retrieve Census data -- use the [`get_acs()` function](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#working-with-acs-data){target="_blank"} to obtain ACS data for specified geographies (e.g. counties or census tracts), tables (e.g. B02001), variables (e.g. B02001_002, B02001_003), years (e.g. 2023), states (e.g. CA), surveys (e.g. acs1, acs5), etc.

[**The following sections (Part 1b - 1d) should be completed via GitHub Classroom (find and accept the assignment link on Slack). Read on for the full assignment description.**]{.teal-text}

### 1b. Create viz #1 + answer questions {#p1b-viz1}

Create a data viz that helps to answer the question, [***How do FEMA National Risk Index scores for counties in California compare to those in other states?***]{.teal-text}, following these steps:

1. **Download and unzip the data:** You'll use the [All Counties - County-level detail (Table)](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/Content/StaticDocuments/DataDownload//NRI_Table_Counties/NRI_Table_Counties.zip) (2023 Release; accessed on the [NRI Data Resources page](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources#csvDownload){target="_blank"}). Unzip the file, then drop the whole `NRI_Table_Counties/` folder into a `data/` folder in your HW repository.
2. **Add your `data/` folder to `.gitignore`**: So we don't accidentally push our data to GitHub!
3. **Read in `NRIDataDictionary.csv`:** `NRI_Table_Counties/` contains a few different files, including this CSV file which describes each of the NRI variables found in `NRI_Table_Counties.csv`. This is a helpful place to start!
4. **Read in `NRI_Table_Counties.csv`:** This is your data.
5. **Build your viz:** This may require some data wrangling first. Your final viz should: 
    - [ ] include data for the 50 US states only (no territories)
    - [ ] include a title (short, descriptive) & subtitle (describes main takeaway) (see [Fundamentals of Data Visualization, Ch 22](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/figure-titles-captions.html){target="_blank"} for an example), a caption (describes the data source, e.g. "Data: FEMA National Risk Index (2023 Release)"), and alt text (following the formula described in [week 3 discussion](../discussion/week3/.qmd#discussion-materials){target="_blank"}; use the `fig-alt` code chunk option to apply your alt text)
    - [ ] consider and implement strategies for highlighting trends / important information (e.g. arranging data, highlighting data, adjusting scales)
    - [ ] use custom colors (if applicable), rather than ggplot defaults 
    - [ ] have an updated / polished theme (you'll learn more about fine-tuning ggplot themes in [week 4 discussion](../week4.qmd#discussion-materials){target="_blank"}) 

::: {.callout-tip}
## BEFORE you start wrangling / building your viz, be sure to...

- identify / jot down your variables of interest and consider which data types they are
- use online tools like [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/){target="_blank} to help determine appropriate graph types, given your variables 
- roughly sketch out your plots by hand (I find this *incredibly* helpful for understanding how my data needs to be wrangled to achieve my desired output(s))

(You'll also want to repeat this process when creating your second data viz in [Part 1c](HW2.qmd#p1c-viz2))
:::

6. **Answer the following questions:**
    - [ ] **a.** What are your variables of interest and what kinds of data (e.g. numeric, categorical, ordered, etc.) are they (a bullet point list is fine)?
    - [ ] **b.** How did you decide which type of graphic form was best suited for answering the question? What alternative graphic forms could you have used instead? Why did you settle on this particular graphic form?
    - [ ] **c.** What modifications did you make to this viz to make it more easily readable?
    - [ ] **d.** Is there anything you wanted to implement, but didn't know how? If so, please describe.
