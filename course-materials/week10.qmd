## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-discussion Prep {#pre-discussion-prep} 

### A. Prepare your final presentation 

We'll use our last discussion section to give and receive feedback on final presentation plans. To prepare:

1. Review the requirements for your final presentation, which are detailed in [HW #4](assignments/HW4.qmd#part3-present){target="_blank"}, and consider your responses to each of them

2. Prepare a Google slide deck (or other presentation format, though it must be easily shareable with Sam, so that she can have it open and ready on her computer on the day of final presentations {{< fa face-smile title="a smiling face" >}}) with your visualization(s). You may choose how to organize your slides and present your data visualization(s), though you should limit the total number to ~3 slides (for a 3 minute-long presentation). 

3. Practice your talk! You don't need to have a *perfectly* polished draft presentation, but the closer you get it to your ideal version, the better. You'll be practicing your talk in front of 1-2 of your peers during section.
