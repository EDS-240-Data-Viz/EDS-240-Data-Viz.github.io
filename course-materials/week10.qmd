### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
library(waffle) # for making waffle (square pie) charts in R
library(ggbump) # a geom for creating bump charts
```

### B. Download .qmd templates 

Download all necessary templates (links in the table below) and save them to a `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/week10/` folder. No need to review any of the code ahead of class -- we'll be walking through it all together.

### A. Prepare your final presentation 

We'll use our last lab section to give and receive feedback on final presentation plans. To prepare:

1. Review the requirements for your final presentation, which are detailed in [FPM #5](assignments/FPM5.qmd){target="_blank"}, and consider your responses to each of them

2. Prepare a Google slide deck (or other presentation format, though it must be easily shareable with Sam, so that she can have it open and ready on her computer on the day of final presentations) with your visualization(s). You're welcome to present just your final data viz deliverable (e.g. infographic) on it's own (i.e. without a slide deck), though you should still be prepared to talk through the [required points](assignments/FPM5.qmd){target="_blank"}

3. Practice your talk! You don't need to have a *perfectly* polished draft presentation, but the closer you get it to your ideal version, the better. You'll be practicing your talk in front of 1-2 of your peers during section.
