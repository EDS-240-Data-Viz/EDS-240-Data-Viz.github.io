*Coming soon!*

<!-- There's no *required* prep for this week's lecture. You will be able to make temporary edits to Allison's [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/) while in [Tinker mode](https://observablehq.com/documentation/collaboration/tinker-mode). If you'd like to save your changes, you may *optionally* [create a free starter account](https://observablehq.com/documentation/accounts-workspaces/accounts) (I chose to sign up using my GitHub credentials, but multiple options are provided), then [fork](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/forking) the [notebook](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/eds-240-javascript-data-viz-follow).  -->

<!-- ### What is Observable JS? -->

<!-- From the Quarto documentation: -->

<!-- >"[Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-javascript) is a set of enhancements to vanilla^1^ JavaScript created by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock) (also the author of [D3](https://d3js.org/)). Observable JS is distinguished by its [reactive runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime), which is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis." -->

<!-- [*^1^**vanilla** JavaScript is JavaScript code that is written without the aid of any external libraries or frameworks (comparable to using only base R without additional packages, e.g. like those in the `{tidyverse}`)*]{.body-text-s} -->

<!-- ### Observable Notebook(s) -->

<!-- - [EDS 240: Data visualization in JavaScript (Follow-along version)](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/eds-240-javascript-data-viz-follow) (you'll want to Tinker with or fork this version if you want to follow along with Allison's instruction) -->
<!-- - [EDS 240: Data visualization in JavaScript (Key)](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/eds-240-javascript-data-viz) (this version includes *all* the code Allison will cover, in case you need to refer to in during class or return to it afterwards) -->

<!-- ### Additional resources -->

<!-- - [Add JavaScript to your dataviz toolkit with Observable Plot: Learner Version](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/r-ladies-observable-plot-feb-2023-learner-version), by Allison Horst & Ananya Roy -- materials from R-Ladies Santa Barbara meetup (2023-05-24) -->
<!-- - [Intro to Observable Plot: Exploring Taylor Swift Songs with Observable Plot](https://github.com/tashapiro/intro-observable?tab=readme-ov-file), by Tanya Shapiro -- materials from R-Ladies Philly workshop (2023-11-09) -->
