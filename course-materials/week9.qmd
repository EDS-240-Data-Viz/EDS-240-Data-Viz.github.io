## Pre-class Prep

There's no *required* prep for this week's lecture. You will be able to make temporary edits to Allison's [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/) while in [Tinker mode](https://observablehq.com/documentation/collaboration/tinker-mode). If you'd like to save your changes, you may *optionally* [create a free starter account](https://observablehq.com/documentation/accounts-workspaces/accounts) (I chose to sign up using my GitHub credentials, but multiple options are provided), then [fork](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/forking) the notebook. Further instructions will be provided during lecture!

### What is Observable JS?

From the Quarto documentation:

>"[Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-javascript) is a set of enhancements to vanilla^1^ JavaScript created by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock) (also the author of [D3](https://d3js.org/)). Observable JS is distinguished by its [reactive runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime), which is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis."

[*^1^**vanilla** JavaScript is JavaScript code that is written without the aid of any external libraries or frameworks (comparable to using only base R without additional packages, e.g. like those in the `{tidyverse}`)*]{.body-text-s}
