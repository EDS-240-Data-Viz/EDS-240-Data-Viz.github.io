## Pre-class Prep

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### Install required packages
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("ggalt") # extra coordinate systems, geoms, statistical transformations, scales and fonts for 'ggplot2' (includes `geom_lollipop()`)
```

## Lecture Materials 

Week 4 instruction is broken down into three lessons:

## Discussion Materials

**Themes** are used to modify the non-data components of plots (e.g. titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, legend). In addition to using pre-built themes (available via the [`{ggplot2}` package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) and also from extension packages), you can fine-tune the appearance of your plots theme by making adjustments using the [`theme()` function](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html). This week's discussion section will introduce the use of themes so that you can start to really make your data visualizations stand out {{< fa palette title="a paint palette" >}}

### Applying pre-built themes:

`{ggplot2}` comes with eight [complete themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html), which can be applied as-is, or further modified using `theme()` (see next section, below). There are also *many* additional themes which can be applied via ggplot extension packages. A small handful of packages are listed in the expandable note, below:

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## A non-exhaustive list of ggplot theme extension packages

- **[`{ggthemes}`](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/)**: a collection of popular themes, some of which also come with corresponding color scales
- **[`{hrbrthemes}`](https://cinc.rud.is/web/packages/hrbrthemes/index.html)**: typographic-centric themes and theme components
- **[`{ggthemr}`](https://github.com/Mikata-Project/ggthemr)**: a collection of color palettes and plot layouts for quickly setting a ggplot theme 
- **[`{ggtech}`](https://github.com/ricardo-bion/ggtech)**: themes based off large tech company color palettes
- **[`{ggdark}`](https://github.com/nsgrantham/ggdark)**: dark mode for ggplot complete themes
- **[`{firatheme}`](https://github.com/vankesteren/firatheme)**: a ggplot theme with [Fira font](https://fonts.google.com/?query=fira)
- **[`{urbnthemes}`](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/urbnthemes/index.html)**: tools for creating [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/)-themed plots and maps in R (also check out the [Urban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) for a really great example of how an organization enforces a cohesive style across all published data viz content)
- **[`{bbplot}`](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot/)**: tools for creating ggplots in the style used by the [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news) data team
- **[`{ggpomological}`](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/ggpomological/)**: a ggplot2 theme based on the [USDA Pomological Watercolor Collection](https://search.nal.usda.gov/discovery/collectionDiscovery?vid=01NAL_INST:MAIN&collectionId=81279629860007426)
- **[`{tvthemes}`](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-05-16-introducing-tvthemes-package/)**: a collection of ggplot themes and color / fill palettes based on everybodyâ€™s favorite TV shows

Keep your eye out for extension packages that supply both a geom(s) *and* a pre-build theme(s) designed specifically to work with that geom. For example, the [`{ggridges}` package](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/index.html) provides both a few different ridgeline plot geoms and a [pre-built `theme_ridges()` theme](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/articles/introduction.html#themes) to pair with them.

### Using `ggplot2::theme()` to control plot elements:

Use this (non-exhaustive) list to start tweaking elements of your plot's appearance. It's most common to start with a pre-built theme (see above) and modify from there. For a complete list of elements, explore the documentation for [`ggplot::theme()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html).

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%" 
#| fig-alt: "A ggplot scatterplot of penguin bill dimensions (bill depth by bill length), with arrows pointing to different non-data elements that can be adjusted using ggplot2 theme controls"
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ggplot-theme.png")
```

### Exercise

This week, you'll practice updating different ggplot theme elements. Choose some of the starter code below, apply a pre-built theme, then modify different pieces of the plot using `theme()`. Plan to share out something new that you've learned with the rest of the class.
