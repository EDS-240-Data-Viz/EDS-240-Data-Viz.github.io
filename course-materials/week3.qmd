## Pre-class Prep

Please be sure to complete the following before class:

### Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("tidytuesdayR") # used to access TidyTuesday data
install.packages("tidycensus") #
install.packages("janitor") # 
install.packages("ggridges") # {ggplot2} extension for creating ridgeline plots
install.packages("gghighlight") # {ggplot2} extension for highlighting geoms
```

<!-- install.packages("refugees") # a package designed to facilitate access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Refugee Data Finder; includes the `population` data set, which we'll use for plotting  -->

### Download data

- [County-level Lyme disease data from 2001-2020](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/datasurveillance/LD-Case-Counts-by-County-01-20.csv), made available by the CDC (read more on [this CDC web page](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/survfaq.html))
  - rename file as `lyme-cdc-2001-2020.csv` and save to your class repo at the file path: `EDS-240-class-examples/week3/data/lyme-cdc-2001-2020.csv`

### Request a US Census Bureau API key

1. To use the [`{tidycensus}` package]() to access US Census Bureau data, you'll first need to **request and activate an API key**. Do so by following these steps:

    a. Request an API key at <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>
    b. After a short period of time, you should receive an email with your key (it may be helpful to star/bookmark that email), and click the included link to activate your key (**Note:** if you get an error when activating your key, close your browser window and try clicking the activation link again)

2. **For security purposes, you should never push any API keys to GitHub.** To prevent us from accidentally pushing our key(s), we can save it to a separate file which we'll add to our `.gitignore`. Do so by following these steps:

  a. Create a file in your class repo's root directory called `KEYS.R`, and save your API key to an object name like this:

```{r filename="KEYS.R"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
censusKEY <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

  b. Add `KEYS.R` to your `.gitignore`

```{r filename=".gitignore"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
KEYS.R
```

  c. Save `.gitignore` (once saved, you should see the newly added/modified `KEYS.R` file disappear from your **Git** pane in RStudio, and a modified `.gitignore` appear). Stage/add, commit, and push this `.gitignore` file to GitHub
  
In class, we'll source our key (by running `source(KEYS.R)`) into any scripts/Qmd files where required.
