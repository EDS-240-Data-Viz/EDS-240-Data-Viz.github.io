## Pre-class Prep

Before coming to class, you'll need to install some packages, download data, and request a US Census Bureau API key. For step-by-step instructions, unfold the following note (collapsed to save space):

## Step-by-step pre-class prep instructions

### Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("chron") # for working with dates / times
install.packages("naniar") # tools for exploring & handing missing data
install.packages("tidytuesdayR") # used to download TidyTuesday data
install.packages("tidycensus") # an R package that allows users to interface with a select number of the US Census Bureauâ€™s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames
install.packages("ggridges") # {ggplot2} extension for creating ridgeline plots
install.packages("gghighlight") # {ggplot2} extension for highlighting geoms
install.packages("ggbeeswarm") # {ggplot2} extension for creating categorical scatter (violin point) plots
install.packages("see") # {ggplot2} extension for model visualization (we'll be using it for it's geom, geom_violindot())
install.packages("scales") # provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2, and gives you tools to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and palettes (installed automatically with {ggplot2} or {tidyverse})
```

### Download data

- [County-level Lyme disease data from 2001-2020](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/datasurveillance/LD-Case-Counts-by-County-01-20.csv), made available by the CDC (read more on [this CDC web page](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/survfaq.html))
  - save the downloaded data (`LD-Case-Counts-by-County-01-20.csv`) to your class repo at the file path: `EDS-240-class-examples/week3/data/LD-Case-Counts-by-County-01-20.csv`

### Request a US Census Bureau API key

1. To use the [`{tidycensus}` package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) to access US Census Bureau data, you'll first need to **request and activate an API key**. Do so by following these steps:

    a. Request an API key at <http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>
    b. After a short period of time, you should receive an email with your key (it may be helpful to star/bookmark that email), and click the included link to activate your key (**Note:** if you get an error when activating your key, close your browser window and try clicking the activation link again)

2. **For security purposes, you should never push any API keys to GitHub.** To prevent us from accidentally pushing our key(s), we can save it to a separate file which we'll add to our `.gitignore`. Do so by following these steps:

  a. Create a `week3/` folder in the root directory of your class repo 
  
  b. Add a file to your `week3/` folder called `KEYS.R`, and save your API key to an object name like this:

```{r filename="~/week3/KEYS.R"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
censusKEY <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

  b. Add `KEYS.R` to your `.gitignore`

```{r filename=".gitignore"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
/week3/KEYS.R
```

  c. Save `.gitignore` (once saved, you should see the newly added `KEYS.R` file disappear from your **Git** pane in RStudio, and a modified `.gitignore` appear). Stage/add, commit, and push this `.gitignore` file to GitHub
  
In class, we'll source our key (by running `source(here::here("week3", "KEYS.R"))`) into any scripts / Qmd files, where required.

## Discussion Materials

### Pre-discussion Prep

**Before coming to section, please be sure to:**

1. Install the following packages:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("geofacet") # facet data for different geographical regions using panels arranged in shapes that mimic geographic topology
```

2. **(Optional)** Install the [ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) Google Chrome extension, which makes it easy to select color values from webpages.

### Background

The [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (USDM) is a collection of measures that allows experts to assess droughts in the United States. It is produced through a partnership between the [National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://drought.unl.edu/), the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/). You can download and explore comprehensive statistics through their [data portal](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx).

The [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) community wrangled and visualized USDM data back in 2021 ([2021-07-20, week 30](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md)), so we'll use the `{tidytuesdayR}` package to import some minimally-tidied data (TidyTuesday always provides the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md#cleaning-script) that the organizers used to pre-process any of the data provided -- these data comprise three separate data sets, which were converted from wide to long format, joined together, and had some columns renamed).

[**Over the course of the next two discussion sections (week 3 & week 4), you'll be recreating the following data visualization produced by U.S. Drought Monitor, which you can find on the [*Droughts in California* Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_in_California):**]{.teal-text}

<br>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("../images/usdm.png")
```

<br>

[**This week, we'll focus on the data layer, geometric layer, and scales. Next week, we'll work on tweaking the theme (all non-data elements) to get it to look just like the U.S. Drought Monitor's version.**]{.teal-text}

### Solution

<!-- ::: {.center-text} -->
<!-- *Complete code will be posted here after both discussion sections are finished.* -->

You'll get the most out of discussion section if you physically type out the code yourself (rather than copying / pasting)!
