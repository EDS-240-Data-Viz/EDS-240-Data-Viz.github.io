## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-class Prep {#pre-class-prep}

### A. Install required packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
install.packages("paletteer") # a comprehensive collection of color palettes in R using a common interface
install.packages("viridis") # Colorblind-Friendly Color Maps for R
install.packages("RColorBrewer") # ColorBrewer Palettes
install.packages("tigris") # for downloading and using Census TIGER/Line shapefiles in R
```

### B. Download data
  
1. Download [County-level precipitation data (Jan 2020 - Dec 2024) for the contiguous U.S](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/county/mapping/110/pcp/202412/60/value){target="_blank"}, made available by [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"} (you do not need to adjust any of the drop down selections; find the download buttons just beneath the rendered map -- **choose the CSV option**)
    - rename the data file as `county-jan20-dec24-precip.csv` and save it to your class repo at the file path: `EDS-240-class-examples/week5/data/county-jan20-dec24-precip.csv`

### C. Download .qmd templates & review data wrangling code

1. Download all necessary templates (links in the table below) and save them to a `EDS-240-data-viz-examples/week5/` folder.

2. Review the data wrangling code under the `## Setup` section of <sup>1</sup>each template file and make note of any questions you might have. Due to time constraints, we won't be live-coding our way through the data wrangling code in class. However, we'll reserve some time to answer any questions before we jump into data viz {{< fa face-smile title="a smiling face" >}}. 

*<sup>1</sup>We will walk through the 5.3 template setup / wrangling code together in class, but it will still benefit you to review it a bit beforehand!*

### D. (OPTIONAL, but highly recommended) Install Google Chrome extensions

I'll be using both of these (really wonderful and easy-to-use) tools during lecture and encourage you to install them!

1. **[Let's get color blind](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lets-get-color-blind/bkdgdianpkfahpkmphgehigalpighjck){target="_blank"}**: simulates different color deficiencies in the browser
2. **[Grayscale the Web](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grayscale-the-web-save-si/mblmpdpfppogibmoobibfannckeeleag){target="_blank"}**: turn specific sites or tabs grayscale
3. **[ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg){target="_blank"}**: a browser-based color chooser tool (I recommended that you install this for week 2 discussion, so you may already have it!)

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-discussion Prep {#pre-discussion-prep} 

### A. (OPTIONAL) Bring a cool data viz!

This week's discussion section will be a time to explore, share, and discuss "non-standard" chart types, as well as those that present data using the fundamental chart types we've already discussed in different and exciting ways. You'll have time to browse some data viz during section, but it would be great to bring any inspiring examples you might have come across already.

### B. (OPTIONAL) Get yourself a Bluesky account

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/){target="_blank"} is quickly becoming the Twitter replacement for data science community members to connect, share, and learn together. You can stay up to date on [#TidyTuesday](https://bsky.app/hashtag/TidyTuesday){target="_blank"} submissions and follow many of the great data viz folks in the field. Check out the [resources page](../resources.qmd#online-communities) for more information on how to get started.

## {{< fa comments title="two speech bubbles" >}} Discussion Materials {#discussion-materials}

<!-- This week, you'll move beyond the fundamental graphic forms that we covered in lecture and discuss some advanced chart types. These are great options to keep in mind as you continue working on your final project ([HW #4](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html))! -->

<!-- This week, you'll be prepping a data visualization using the data you found / wrangled as part of your final project (HW #4). This does not need to be a polished viz, but should focus on clarity of message. You'll be discussing each others' visualizations and commenting on what the main takeaways are (ideally, you'll walk away with the same message as intended by the plot-creator!). Please complete the following ahead of section: -->

<!-- 1. choose a well-thought out question that you'd like to answer with your selected data set(s)  -->
<!-- 2. hand-draw a plot that you want to create (this can be an important first step before even touching any code) -->
<!-- 3. turn your hand-drawn plot into a ggplot in R! -->
<!-- 4. send both your hand-drawn plot *and* your resulting ggplot to Sevan via DM (Slack) by Tuesday (2/6) evening -->
