*No required prep for this week's lecture!*

<!-- You will be able to make temporary edits to Allison's [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/) while in [Tinker mode](https://observablehq.com/documentation/collaboration/tinker-mode). If you'd like to save your changes, you may *optionally* [create a free starter account](https://observablehq.com/documentation/accounts-workspaces/accounts) (I chose to sign up using my GitHub credentials, but multiple options are provided), then [fork](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/forking) the [notebook](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/eds-240-javascript-data-viz-follow). -->

<!-- ### Some background -->

<!-- What is Observable JS? From the Quarto documentation: -->

<!-- >"[Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-javascript) is a set of enhancements to vanilla^1^ JavaScript created by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock) (also the author of [D3](https://d3js.org/)). Observable JS is distinguished by its [reactive runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime), which is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis." -->

<!-- [*^1^**vanilla** JavaScript is JavaScript code that is written without the aid of any external libraries or frameworks (comparable to using only base R without additional packages, e.g. like those in the `{tidyverse}`)*]{.body-text-s} -->


### Observable Notebook(s)

- [EDS 240: Data visualization in JavaScript (Follow-along version)](https://observablehq.com/@allisonhorst/eds-240-data-viz-2025){target="_blank"} (you'll want to Tinker with or fork this version if you want to follow along with Allison's instruction)
- [EDS 240: Data visualization in JavaScript (KEY)](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/eds-240-javascript-data-viz){target="_blank"} (includes all code demoed during class)

### Additional resources

- [Add JavaScript to your dataviz toolkit with Observable Plot: Learner Version](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/r-ladies-observable-plot-feb-2023-learner-version){target="_blank"}, by Allison Horst & Ananya Roy -- materials from R-Ladies Santa Barbara meetup (2023-05-24)
- [Intro to Observable Plot: Exploring Taylor Swift Songs with Observable Plot](https://github.com/tashapiro/intro-observable?tab=readme-ov-file){target="_blank"}, by Tanya Shapiro -- materials from R-Ladies Philly workshop (2023-11-09)
- [Observable's D3 Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery){target="_blank"} -- more than 170 cool viz built with D3 (plus their code)
- [1974…bird attacks?](https://allisonhorst.github.io/posts/2022-10-14-bird-attacks/){target="_blank"}, by Allison Horst -- a blog post that demos a whole bunch of cool skills, but perhaps most relevantly, data wrangling in R then data viz using Observable Plot (and how to do so in Quarto doc `{ojs}` cells)

## {{< fa clipboard-list title="a clipboard with a To Do list" >}} Pre-discussion Prep {#pre-discussion-prep} 
Similar to last week's discussion, we'll be discussing progress on our data visualizations and providing constructive feedback to one another.  

### A. Prepare your data viz slide 

Find your assigned slide from the correct Google Slide deck (see table, under the [Discussion Materials](week8.qmd#discussion-materials) section, below) and add the following:

1. ***(a different) one*** of your three visualizations (i.e. don't choose the same viz that you brought to last discussion section)
2. the question that you're using your visualization to answer
