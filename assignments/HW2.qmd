# [Part I: Choosing the right graphic form]{.pink-text}

## Learning Outcomes 

- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience
- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that itâ€™s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations
- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing, visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically {ggplot2} + ggplot2 extension packages

## Description 

In class, we discussed strategies and considerations for choosing the right graphic form to represent your data and convey your intended message. Here, you'll apply what we've learned to a data set on lobster abundance and sizes, collected from coastal rocky reef sites within the [Santa Barbara Coastal LTER](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/). Unfold the following note to read more about the data before continuing on (collapsed to save space):

## Learn about the data:

#### About SBC LTER
The [Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/) (SBC LTER) site was established in 2000 as part of the [LTER Network](https://lternet.edu/) to understand the ecology of coastal kelp forest ecosystems. Research and long-term ecological and environmental monitoring data is collected within a 10,000 square kilometer area of the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, which includes the Santa Barbara Channel, coastal watersheds, small estuaries, and sandy beaches that border the Channel. You can explore the full [data catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/).

#### About the data set

There are five coastal rocky reef research sites at which the SBC LTER collects long-term monitoring data:

- Naples Reef (NAPL)
- Isla Vista Reef (IVEE)
- Arroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE)
- Mohawk Reef (MOHK)
- Carpinteria Reef (CARP)

In January 2012, [Naples Reef](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/MPAs/Naples) and [Isla Vista Reef](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/MPAs/Campus-Point) were [designated as Marine Protected Areas](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=27928) (MPAs), prohibiting any future take of lobsters (along with other living marine resources). Since then, the SBC LTER has conducted annual (late summer) benthic surveys at each of the above five sites, where SCUBA divers record lobster abundance and sizes. Explore the [metadata](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/package/?package=knb-lter-sbc.77) for more information.  

#### Data citation

Reed, D, R. Miller. 2023. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (*Panulirus interruptus*), ongoing since 2012 ver 9. Environmental Data Initiative. <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/3595322687af94cd532620ad9db94c77>. 

#### Finding this data set

*Knowing how to search for data can be tricky! Here's how I accessed this particular data set, should you want to search for LTER data yourself, in the future:*

1. **Filter the [SBC LTER Data Catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/)** for data sets related to **Reef/Kelp Forest** habitats (check the box next to the habitat type of interest, or filter by measurement type or LTER Core Research Area). This produces a table of data collections, descriptions, and links to individual data and metadata records.
2. **Choose a data set of interest.** I was interested in the *SBC LTER: Spiny lobster in California* Collection, which includes three different data sets. I specifically chose, [Lobster abundace, size, and fishing pressure](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/package/?package=knb-lter-sbc.77) -- here, you'll find lots of metadata, including people and organizations involved in this data collection, temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, methods and protocols, and links to data files. Additionally, you'll see a link to the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77) (top right corner), which is the data repository that maintains all data and metadata produced by the LTER. EDI assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to each version of a data package (data package = data + metadata; SBC LTER updates this data set each year when new data is collected -- each update receives a new DOI).
3. **Download or import the data.** You can download the data file from either the [SBC LTER Data Catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/package/?package=knb-lter-sbc.77) *or* the [EDI Data Package](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77). *However* I prefer reading in the data directly from online (that way, I don't need to worry about storing large data files). I recommend doing this from the [EDI Data Package](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77) (rather than the SBC LTER Data Catalog), since the DOI ensures you can re-reference the exact same version, even after the data set is updated with new data (SBC LTER Data Catalog only has a download link for the most up-to-date version of the data). To do so, right click on the *Download Data* button, then select *Copy Link Address*.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "50%"
knitr::include_graphics("../images/download-lob-data.png")
```

Use this url inside `read_csv()` to import the data into your script or Qmd / Rmd file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
lobster_data <- read_csv("https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.9&entityid=f32823fba432f58f66c06b589b7efac6")
```

:::

Given the above data set, **create a visualization that explores how lobster size differs across each of the five coastal rocky reef SBC LTER sites for the years 2012 (when IVEE and NAPL were established as MPAs) and 2022 (10 years later)**. This will first require some data exploration and wrangling. Some tips (unfold below):

## Data exploration & wrangling tips

[**Data exploration tips:**]{.body-text-l .dark-blue-text}

- Use `glimpse()` and / or `str()` to check out your variables and data types
- Extract unique elements using `unique(df$column_name)`
- Open up the spreadsheet-style data viewer using `View(df)`
- Be sure to review the [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.9) (including methods & protocols) to fully understand the data

[**Data wrangling tips:**]{.body-text-l .dark-blue-text}

- I love starting all my cleaning pipelines with `janitor::clean_names()` to convert column headers into lowercase snake_case (not necessary, but easy to implement and super helpful for yourself and others)
- You'll want to keep just the years of interest
- Missing size measurements are denoted with `-99999` -- consider how to deal with these
- Each row is **not** always a single observation, but rather summed lobster counts at each size observed within a site / transect / replicate. You'll want to wrangle the data such that each row represents a single lobster observation. You may need to do some Googling to figure out a solution for this (HINT: you're looking to perform the opposite of `count()`).
- I often find that I'll need to return to my data wrangling pipeline again *after* I start plotting my data --  it's at this stage that I'll often catch variables that are the wrong data type (e.g. numeric, factor, character) for plotting and need to make the appropriate updates.
:::

[**After exploring and wrangling your data, answer the following questions:**]{.teal-text}

- [ ] **1.** What are your variables of interest and what kinds of data (e.g. numeric, categorical, ordered, etc.) are they? [**(a bullet point list here is fine)**]{.peach-text}
- [ ] **2.** Using [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), identify which visualization forms are appropriate, given your data. List out the visualization types. [**(a bullet point list here is fine)**]{.peach-text}
- [ ] **3.** Now that you have a list of potential visualization types, what are some of your considerations as you decide which to create? For example, is it important / valuable to show sample size? Why or why not? How will you represent multiple groups? etc. Feel free to return to this question after first playing around with some ggplots. [**(3-4 sentences)**]{.peach-text}

Now that you've explored and starting wrangling your data, it's time to create some plots. It's often important to try out multiple graphic forms (e.g. `geom_*()`s) as you decide which is the most effective way of presenting your data. This process is commonly referred to as **Exploratory Data Analysis or Exploratory Data Visualization**. Some tips (unfold below):

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## Data viz creation tips

[**Data viz creation tips:**]{.body-text-l .dark-blue-text}

- I always find it helpful to sketch things out on paper first
- We created a number of different plot types together in class, exploring different geoms and some of the arguments that each ggplot layer can take. Be sure to take a look back at the lecture materials, but also know that you may need to reference documentation and / or online examples to create / modify your intended visualizations.
:::

[**Complete the following:**]{.teal-text}

- [ ] Create at least three different plots as part of your exploratory data visualization phase to test out what visual forms works best. Your last plot should be the version that you feel is best suited for presenting your data. 
    - **NOTE:** Your first two plots *do not* need to be at all polished -- during the exploratory data visualization phase, we're most concerned with choosing a visual form / geom(s) for effectively presenting our data. 
- [ ] For your third (final) plot only: Consider modifications that we discussed in lecture that may make this plot easier to interpret (e.g. updating colors, moving or removing legends, highlighting groups, ordering groups) -- be sure to update your plot as appropriate.
- [ ] Explain why you chose to make the above modifications. [**(3-6 sentences)**]{.peach-text}
- [ ] Polish your third (final) plot by updating the theme (we'll cover this during [week 4 discussion section](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/course-materials/week4.html#discussion-materials)). 
-  [ ] Consider all three of your plots. What about the visual forms / geoms used in plots #1 and #2 was not as effective as plot #3?  [**(5-8 sentences)**]{.peach-text}
- [ ] Describe two or more challenges you encountered while deciding on / creating your plots -- these can be theoretical (e.g. determining how to best represent your data) and / or technical (e.g. code-based challenges). [**(4-8 sentences)**]{.peach-text}
- [ ] Add alt text to your final visualization following the formula discussed during [week 2's discussion section](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/course-materials/discussion/week2/week2-alt-text.html#/title-slide) and using the `#| fig-alt:` code chunk option.
