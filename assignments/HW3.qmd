***You must earn a "Satisfactory" mark for  Part I only to earn a "Satisfactory" mark for Assignment #3 -- Part II is optional extra practice (will not be graded) in case you're looking for some additional practice.***

**NOTE:** Assignments are to be submitted via GitHub Classrooms, unless otherwise noted. Each student receives one "free pass" for not submitting assignments via specified channels, after which you will receive a "Not Yet" mark.

**Read each part of the assignment carefully**, and use the check boxes to ensure you've addressed all elements of the assignment!
