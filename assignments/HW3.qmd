## Learning Objectives

HW #3 will have you focus on making more progress towards completing your final assignment (HW #4). Your final assignment is meant to combine all of the course learning outcomes(!):

- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience
- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that itâ€™s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations
- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically `{ggplot2}` + ggplot2 extension packages
- write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others
- apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations 
- assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations

## Description 

[**Please begin by reviewing [HW #4](HW4.qmd) in full**]{.teal-text} so that you are familiar with the expectations for your final submission at the end of the quarter -- you'll again be making some incremental steps towards your final deliverables here in HW #3. 

[**For HW #3, you must answer / complete the following:**]{.teal-text}

- [ ] Which option do you plan to pursue? It's okay if this has changed since HW #1.
- [ ] Restate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? If yes, how so? 

::: {.callout-note}
Be mindful that the number of questions you list above will depend on which option you choose to pursue:

- If you choose [option 1](HW4.qmd#option-1), you should have **one question** that each of your three visualizations works to answer, where each visualization is meant to reach / serve a different target audience and purpose.
- If you choose [option 2](HW4.qmd#option-2), you should have **one overarching question** and **at least three sub-questions** that each of your infographic components answer.

Please refer to [HW #4](HW4.qmd) for full details on each of these options.
:::

- [ ] Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer your question(s).

::: {.callout-important}
## Important -- be specific here!
For example, let's say I'm interested in how Lyme disease incidence is changing over time for states X, Y and Z. An appropriate explanation of variables might look something like this: 

>*"I have two data sets, one containing population estimates by state from the `{tidycensus}` package, and another from the CDC containing lyme disease case counts by county and year. After wrangling / joining these data sets, I was able to calculate disease incidence as cases per 100k people at the state level. Doing so provides me with three variables to visualize: time (years), disease incidence (cases per 100k people), and state."*

 <!-- I will create a line chart with time (year) on the x-axis and disease incidence (cases per 100k) on the y-axis. Each line will represent a different state. -->
:::

- [ ] In HW #2, you should have created some exploratory data viz to better understand your data. You may already have some ideas of how you plan to formally visualize your data, but it's *incredibly* helpful to look at visualizations by other creators for inspiration. Find at least two data visualizations that you could (potentially) borrow / adapt pieces from. Link to them or download and embed them into your `.qmd` file, and explain which elements you might borrow (e.g. the graphic form, legend design, layout, etc.). 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip: Remember to check out the [Resources page](../resources.qmd)!!
I've added a tons of really wonderful websites, tutorials, and links to the repos / websites of some seriously incredible [data viz creators](../resources.qmd#inspirational-data-visualization-creators). This is an excellent place to start when looking for inspiration.

If you have an account, it can also be helpful to search **#tidytuesday** on [X](https://twitter.com/) (formally known as Twitter).
:::

- [ ] Hand-draw your anticipated three visualizations (option 1) or infographic (which should include at least three component visualizations; option 2). Take a photo of your drawing and embed it in your rendered `.qmd` file -- **note** that these are not *exploratory* visualizations, but rather your plan for your final visualizations that you will eventually polish and submit with HW #4.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip: Embedding images into a `.qmd` file

There are a number of ways to render an image in `.qmd` file. Two ways I find easiest are:

1. Using `knitr::include_graphics()` in a code chunk. Here are the chunk options I often specify:

```{{r}}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-alt: "Alt text here"
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image")
```

2. Using Markdown syntax:

`![](file/path/to/image){fig-alt="Alt text goes here"}`

**Here is a minimal example of a hand-drawn plot -- you don't need to be an artist, but your vision (and handwriting) should be clear:**
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "40%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/hand-drawn-plot.png")
```

:::

- [ ] Mock up **all** of your hand drawn visualizations using code. We understand that you will continue to iterate on these into HW #4 (particularly after receiving feedback), but by the end of HW #3, you should:

  - have your data plotted (if you're experimenting with a graphic form(s) that was not explicitly covered in class, we understand that this may take some more time to build; you should have as much put together as possible)
  - use appropriate strategies to highlight / focus attention on a clear message
  - include appropriate text such as titles, captions, axis labels 
  - experiment with colors and typefaces / fonts
  - create a presentable / aesthetically-pleasing theme (e.g. (re)move gridlines / legends as appropriate, adjust font sizes, etc.)

- [ ] Answer the following questions:
    - [ ] What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R?
    - [ ] What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven't covered in class that you'll be learning how to use for your visualizations?
    - [ ] What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?

## Rubric (specifications)

You must complete the following, as detailed below, to receive a "Satisfactory" mark for Assignment #3:

**Complete the following steps under your `lastName-eds240-HW4` repo:**

- [ ] Complete all work in a file named, `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd` -- you are welcome to draft / practice things in different files / scripts, but you must have all required elements of the assignment available in *this* file for us to reference and grade.
- [ ] Add any necessary YAML options (title, author, date, etc.). You must also include the following options:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
---
# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
---
```

- [ ] Complete all exercises and answer all questions under the [Description section](HW3.qmd#description) above (use the check boxes to ensure you've completed all required parts).

::: {.callout-note}
## A few notes on expectations

- Your plots don't have to be perfect but the message you want to convey should be clear
- The more progress you make now, the more feedback we can provide ahead of HW #4
- There are no strict length requirements for the free-response questions above, however we expect that you answer them thoughtfully and fully 
- Low-effort responses and plots will result in a "Not Yet" mark
:::

- [ ] Ensure all code chunks have the correct options set so that **(a)** code *and* outputs render, and **(b)** warnings and messages are suppressed (unless there is a reason to have them print). *Please note that rendered documents that don't have correctly specified chunk options will receive a "Not Yet" score.*
- [ ] Code should be appropriately styled and annotated (please see [this resource](../clean-code-guide.qmd) on the course website), and your `.qmd` file should be easy to navigate.
- [ ] When complete, **render** your `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd` file, **verify** that you can open the resulting `HW3-drafting-viz.html` file in your browser and that all formatting looks good. **Rename** your `.html` file so that it has your first initial / last name at the start (e.g. `SCsik-HW3-drafting-viz.html`) then **send** it to both Sevan and Sam on Slack via direct message.
