## Books

- **[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), by Claus O. Wilke** -- a primer on making informative and compelling figures
- **[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund** -- an excellent primer on all things R for data wrangling, modeling, and visualizing

## Data viz decision trees

- **[From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), by Yan Holtz & Conor Healy** -- a decision tree for deciding which chart type is most appropriate for your data

## Accessibility

- **[Colorblind Safe Color Schemes](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Colorblind%20Safe%20Color%20Schemes.pdf), by the NCEAS Science Communication Resource Center** -- tips and examples of colorblind-friendly color palettes
- **[How to write good alternative descriptions for your data visualization](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/330-how-to-write-good-alternative-descriptions-for-your-data-visualization), by Amy Cesal** -- great instructions (and examples) on how to construct informative alt text for data visualizations 

## Inspirational `{ggplot2}` creators

(In my honest opinion) One of the best ways to learn how to build exciting ggplots is to look at code that others have written. Here are just a few folks doing really incredible work (along with their repos where they often showcase their creations): 

| Creator      | {{< fa brands github >}} Data Viz Repository |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Ijeamaka Anyene](https://ijeamaka-anyene.netlify.app/) | [tidytuesday](https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene/tidytuesday) |
| [Cédric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/) | [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday) |
| [Tanya Shapiro](https://tanyaviz.com/) | [tanya-data-viz](https://github.com/tashapiro/tanya-data-viz) |
| [Cara Thompson](https://www.cararthompson.com/index.html) | [tidytuesdays](https://github.com/cararthompson/tidytuesdays) |

## Misc.

- **[awesome-ggplot2](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2), by 
Erik Gahner Larsen** -- a curated list of awesome ggplot2 tutorials, packages etc.

## R packages

A list of the R packages that we've covered in this class so far:

- **[`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/):** a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "50%" 
#| fig-alt: "A person in a cape that reads 'code hero' who looks like they are flying through the air while typing on a computer while saying 'I’m doing a think all on my own!' The coder’s arms and legs have ropes attached to two hot air balloons lifting them up, with labels on the balloons including 'teachers', 'bloggers', 'friends', 'developers'. Below the code hero, several people carry a trampoline with labels 'support' and “community” that will catch them if they fall."
