## Data sources

Data are *everywhere*, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily easy to track down. Here are some of the places I've found and used data from (or at least considered using data from). If you've found a cool data source (particularly if it's a source of environmental data), I would love to know! It can help me build out teaching materials with new / different examples, and also help your peers who may be searching for similar data. Please consider contributing data sources using [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/uYC7eEie1XZ7D4Xm6).

### data repositories
