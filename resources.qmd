- **[](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/), by Cédric Scherer** -- a blogpost that might as well be a book; an excellent introduction to many different ggplot options, ideas, and extension packages

## Inspirational data visualization creators

### `{ggplot2}` creators

(In my honest opinion) One of the best ways to learn how to build exciting ggplots is to look at code that others have written. Here are just a few folks doing really incredible work (along with their repos where they often showcase their creations):

### Other seriously amazing data visualizationists 

Definitely don't limit yourself to just `{ggplot2}` creators! There are so many incredible data story-tellers and information designers to draw inspiration and learn from. Just a few:

- [Nadieh Bremer](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/)
- [Mona Chalabi](https://monachalabi.com/)
- [Sonja Kuijpers](https://www.studioterp.nl)
- [Giorgia Lupi](https://giorgialupi.com/)

## Data sources

Data are *everywhere*, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily easy to track down. Here are some of the places I've found and used data from (or at least considered using data from). If you've found a cool data source (particularly if it's a source of environmental data), I would love to know! It can help me build out teaching materials with new / different examples, and also help your peers who may be searching for similar data. Please consider contributing data sources using [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/uYC7eEie1XZ7D4Xm6).

### Data Repositories
- **[DataOne](https://www.dataone.org/)** –  a repository of data repositories! Search across all member repositories (including repositories like [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp), [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/catalog), [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), etc.) for environmental data (along with curated metadata records)
- **[EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp)** – contains environmental and ecological data and metadata derived from publicly funded research contributed by a number of participating organizations (e.g. EDI is the main repository for all [Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)](https://lternet.edu/) data)

### Newsletters / Data Collections

- **[tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)** – a weekly social data project that shares minimally-cleaned data sets covering a variety of topics for the [R4DS community](https://rfordatasci.com/) to visualize; organizers share links to the original data sources, as well as the scripts used to clean them prior to publishing
- **[awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)** – a repository containing a list of high quality, topic-centric public data sources 

### Government Agencies
- **[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html)** – there are tons of data sets buried in the pages of this website (you'll likely have to do a bit of digging)
- **[Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/organization/)** – view data sets by the federal agency, state, city, or county that publishes them
- **[EPA's National Emissions Inventory (NEI) Data Retrieval Tool](https://awsedap.epa.gov/public/single/?appid=20230c40-026d-494e-903f-3f112761a208&sheet=5d3fdda7-14bc-4284-a9bb-cfd856b9348d&opt=ctxmenu,currsel)** – read more about NEI Data on the [EPA's website](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2020-national-emissions-inventory-nei-data)
- **[NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/)** – specifically, check out their [Climate Monitoring Products](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/products/) (I used the [County Mapping](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/county/mapping/110/pcp/202310/1/value) interface to download precipitation data featured in [Lecture 3.1](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/slides/week3.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/caveats1.1)'s choropleth map)
- **[`{tidycensus}` package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)** – tooling that allows R users to more easily interface with a select number of the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/)'s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames

## Misc.

- **[awesome-ggplot2](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2), by Erik Gahner Larsen** -- a curated list of awesome ggplot2 tutorials, packages etc.
- **[Climate Viz](https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/climate-data-vis/), by Datawrapper** -- a collection of blog posts on data visualizations created with [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) that help us (and hopefully you) to understand global warming and what humanity can do against it

## Learning communities

Online communities: 

- **[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), by the R4DS Online Learning Community** -- a weekly data project in R, and an *excellent* (dare I say, *the best*) way to practice your data wrangling & visualization skills

The following Santa Barbara-based groups hold regular meetups, workshops, networking events, and more:

- **[EcoDataScience](https://ecodatascience.github.io/)** -- an environmental data science community based at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), open to anyone who is interested in joining the journey of learning, advancing and applying data science skills in the environmental and ecological field
- **[R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/)** -- a local chapter of R-Ladies Global, which exists to promote diversity in the R community
- **[Santa Barbara Women in STEM](https://sbwomeninstem.org/)** -- a local network of professionals with a common goal to promote and encourage women in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math
