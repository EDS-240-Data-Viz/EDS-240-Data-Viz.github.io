It's often imperative to build up your visualizations, slide-by-slide, adding data layers bit-by-bit. Oftentimes, you will only present a subset of data on any given figure. Key takeaways should be clearly highlighted. For this visualization, consider how you would layer on data and what arrows / annotations you'd potentially animate in to make your messaging clear.\n\nWe've seen a *lots* of amazing visualizations throughout the quarter. Be sure to take a look through past lectures, and *definitely* check out the [resources page](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/resources.html#inspirational-data-visualization-creators) to see work from some of my favorite data viz creators. Here are just a few cool / helpful pieces to get the creative thoughts flowing: \n\n**The following examples fall into the first cateogry, above (for a general audience):**\n\n- [The Rise of Craft Beer!](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday?tab=readme-ov-file#week-202014--beer-production-by-ttb), by [Cédric Scherer](https://github.com/z3tt) (this is an awesome example of how a relatively simple graphic form (i.e. a bar chart) can be made into an engaging piece for a general audience)\n- [Seasonality of Bird Collisions in Chicago](https://twitter.com/jakekaupp/status/1123688940530274305/photo/1), by [Jake Kaupp](https://github.com/jkaupp)\n- [Ratings of Japanese Instant Shio Ramen](https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday/tree/master/2019/2019-week-23), by [Georgios Karamanis](https://github.com/gkaramanis)\n- [A is for Actrapid, Z is for Zyprexa](https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday/tree/master/2023/2023-week_11), by [Georgios Karamanis](https://github.com/gkaramanis)\n- [The Rise of Adobe Inc.](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/tree/main/2023/2023-02-07), by [Nicola Rennie](https://github.com/nrennie) (Nicola also records all of her tidytuesday contributions using the [`{camcorder} package)`](https://github.com/thebioengineer/camcorder))\n\n**These are two excellent examples of how you might adapt a publication-worthy visualization for an oral presentation (categories two and three, above):**\n\n- [Alex Phillips'](https://www.alexandraatleephillips.com/) [Ten Tips for Presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z9URIEa5Ex7FtDcTMTPbQrWO7mD8XHhdzlKLZzXhfEQ/edit#slide=id.g22281abf1c9_0_134) lecture features a visualization from [Rougier et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833)\n- SciFig's [Spectrum of Figure Creation](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/tree/e13819c333c6a333dc4a2dde96fdfe8c264389c4?tab=readme-ov-file#spectrum-of-figure-creation) (you'll need to expand the **Details** drop-down) \n\n### OPTION 2: \n\n[**Build a cohesive infographic-style visualization that includes *at least three* different, but complementary visualizations that work together to tell a complete story. You should have one overarching question with (at least) three sub-questions which are addressed using each of the component pieces of the infographic.**]{.teal-text}\n\nAn infographic typically exists to address one overarching question or idea, and it's subcomponents (e.g. visualizations, numbers, imagery) each help to tell part of the story (or in other words, help to answer sub-questions). While text is important in all visualizations, it can be particularly critical in weaving together all your infographic elements to successfully convey your story. The order and orientation in which your elements are positioned will also be essential for creating a visual hierarchy that successfully guides your readers. Packages like [`{patchwork}`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) will likely be critical in stitching together the different elements of your infographic.\n\nI encourage you to look back at past lecture materials and to check out the [resources page](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/resources.html#inspirational-data-visualization-creators) to explore the works of some really cool data viz creators.

If your visualizations do not include and / or consider a listed element(s), please comment on why (it's possible that not all will be applicable to *your* visualizations, but be sure to say why that is the case).\n\n[**You may submit your assignment in one of two ways:**]{.teal-text}\n\n1. **A published Quarto document that is deployed using GitHub Pages**\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## Instructions for publishing a Quarto doc using GitHub Pages\n\n1. Your Quarto doc must be named `index.qmd` *and* live in your repository's root directory. Be sure to rename / move it, if necessary.\n2. Head to your remote repository on GitHub. Navigate to the **Settings** page (top navbar), then select **Pages** from the left-hand menu. Once there, you should see something that looks like this: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/pages.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, update the drop down that says **None** to **main**. Leave the second drop down on **/(root)** (this tells GitHub to look for and deploy our `index.html` file from the root directory of the main branch). Click **Save**. Your URL will appear at the top of the page once it's deployed (you will need to refresh the page -- this could take a few minutes):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/settings-mod.png){width=1552}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/deployed.png){width=1552}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n2. **As a blog post on your personal website** -- check out the [Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) workshop materials for a refresher, if needed\n\n## Rubric (specifications)\n\nYou must complete the following to receive a “Satisfactory” mark for Assignment #4:\n\n- [ ] complete [option 1](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html#option-1) or [option 2](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html#option-2), as detailed\n- [ ] all data visualizations must implement the ten design elements (listed above), *as appropriate* (it's up to you to decide when to consider, include, omit, modify any of these elements)\n- [ ] all code should be appropriately formatted, annotated, and code chunks should all have the appropriate chunk options specified (see above for all details).\n- [ ] describe your design process and decisions in a 1-2 page write-up, as described above\n- [ ] submit your work as either a published Quarto doc or as a blog post on your personal website\n- [ ] add the link to your published Quarto doc / blog post to [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tv32Ng_-QI1-eB5ws59HgCN0EoOpHe4UHX6qHhbQGds/edit#gid=0)\n- [ ] present your visualizations to the class on [date] (finals week)\n",
