Each student receives one \"free pass\" for not submitting assignments via specified channels, after which you will receive a \"Not Yet\" mark. -->\n\n<!-- **Read each part of the assignment carefully**, and use the check boxes to ensure you've addressed all elements of the assignment! -->\n<!-- </div> -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nHW #3 will have you focus on making more progress towards completing your final assignment (HW #4). Your final assignment is meant to combine all of the course learning outcomes(!):\n\n- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience\n- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that itâ€™s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations\n- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically `{ggplot2}` + ggplot2 extension packages\n- write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others\n- apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations \n- assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations\n\n## Description \n\n**Please begin by reviewing the [description for HW #4](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html)** so that you are familiar with the expectations for your final submission at the end of the quarter -- we'll again be making some more incremental steps towards our final deliverables here in HW #3. \n\n[**For HW #3, you must complete the following:**]{.teal-text}\n\n- [ ] Which option do you plan to pursue?\n- [ ] Restate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? If yes, how so? \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nBe mindful that the number of questions you list above will depend on which option you choose to pursue:\n\n- If you choose [option 1](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html#option-1), you should have **one question** that each of your three visualizations works to answer, where each visualization is meant to reach / serve a different target audience and purpose.\n- If you choose [option 2](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html#option-2), you should have **one overarching question** and **at least three sub-questions** that each of your infographic components answer.\n\nPlease refer to [HW #4](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW4.html) for full details on each of these options.\n:::\n\n- [ ] Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer your question(s).\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Important -- be specific here!\nFor example, let's say I'm interested in how Lyme disease incidence is changing over time for states X, Y and Z. An appropriate explanation of variables might look something like this: \n\n>*\"I have two data sets, one containing population estimates by state from the `{tidycensus}` package, and another from the CDC containing lyme disease case counts by county and year. After wrangling / joining these data sets, I was able to calculate disease incidence as cases per 100k people at the state level. Doing so provides me with three variables to visualize: time (years), disease incidence (cases per 100k people), and state.\"*\n\n <!-- I will create a line chart with time (year) on the x-axis and disease incidence (cases per 100k) on the y-axis. Each line will represent a different state. -->\n:::\n\n- [ ] In HW #2, you should have created some exploratory data viz to better understand your data. You may already have some ideas of how you plan to formally visualize your data, but it's *incredibly* helpful to look at visualizations by other creators for inspiration. Find at least two data visualizations that you could (potentially) borrow / adapt pieces from. Link to them or download and embed them into your `.qmd` file, and explain which elements you might borrow (e.g. the graphic form, legend design, layout, etc.). \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip: Remember to check out the [Resources page](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/resources.html)!!\nI've added a tons of really wonderful websites, tutorials, and links to the repos / websites of some seriously incredible [data viz creators](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/resources.html#inspirational-data-visualization-creators). This is an excellent place to start when looking for inspiration.\n\nIf you have an account, it can also be helpful to search **#tidytuesday** on [X](https://twitter.com/) (formally known as Twitter).\n:::\n\n- [ ] Hand-draw your anticipated three visualizations (option 1) or infographic (option 2). Take a photo of your drawing and embed it in your rendered `.qmd` file -- **note** that these are not *exploratory* visualizations, but rather your plan for your final visualizations that you will eventually polish and submit with HW #4.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip: Embedding images into a `.qmd` file\n\nThere are a number of ways to render an image in `.qmd` file. Two ways I find easiest are:\n\n1. Using `knitr::include_graphics()` in a code chunk. Here are the chunk options I often specify:\n\n```{{r}}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-align: \"center\"\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| fig-alt: \"Alt text here\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"path/to/image\")\n```\n\n2. Using Markdown syntax:\n\n`![](file/path/to/image){fig-alt=\"Alt text goes here\"}`\n\n**Here is a minimal example of a hand-drawn plot -- you don't need to be an artist, but your vision (and handwriting) should be clear:**\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/hand-drawn-plot.png){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n- [ ] Mock up your visualizations using code. We understand that you will continue to iterate on these into HW #4 (particularly after receiving feedback), but by the end of HW #3, you should:\n\n  - have your data plotted (if you're experimenting with an advanced graphic form(s) that were not explicitly covered in class, we understand that this may take some more time to build; you should have as much put together as possible)\n  - use appropriate strategies to highlight / focus attention on a clear message\n  - include appropriate text such as titles, captions, axis labels \n  - experiment with colors and typefaces / fonts\n  - create a presentable / aesthetically-pleasing theme (e.g. (re)move gridlines / legends as appropriate, adjust font sizes, etc.)\n\n- [ ] Answer the following questions:\n    - [ ] What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R?\n    - [ ] What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven't covered in class that you'll be learning how to use for your visualizations?\n    - [ ] What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?\n\n## Rubric (specifications)\n\nYou must complete the following, as detailed below, to receive a \"Satisfactory\" mark for Assignment #3:\n\n**Complete the following steps under your `lastName-eds240-HW4` repo:**\n\n- [ ] Complete all work in a file named, `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd` -- you are welcome to draft / practice things in different files / scripts, but you must have all required elements of the assignment available in *this* file for us to reference and grade.\n- [ ] Add any necessary YAML options (title, author, date, etc.). You must also include the following options:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"false\"}\n---\n# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n---\n```\n:::\n\n\n- [ ] Complete all exercises and answer all questions under the [Description section](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/assignments/HW3.html#description) above (use the check boxes to ensure you've completed all required parts).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## A few notes on expectations\n\n- Your plots don't have to be perfect but the message you want to convey should be clear\n- The more progress you make now, the more feedback we can provide ahead of HW #4\n- There are no strict length requirements for the free-response questions above. However, we expect that you answer them thoughtfully and fully. Low-effort responses will result in a \"Not Yet\" mark.\n:::\n\n- [ ] Ensure all code chunks have the correct options set so that **(a)** code *and* outputs render, and **(b)** warnings and messages are suppressed (unless there is a reason to have them print). *Please note that rendered documents that don't have correctly specified chunk options will receive a \"Not Yet\" score.*\n- [ ] Code should be appropriately styled and annotated (please see [this resource](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/clean-code-guide.html) on the course website), and your `.qmd` file should be easy to navigate.\n- [ ] When complete, **render** your `HW3-drafting-viz.qmd` file, **verify** that you can open the resulting `HW3-drafting-viz.html` file in your browser and that all formatting looks good. **Rename** your `.html` file so that it has your first initial / last name at the start (e.g. `SCsik-HW3-drafting-viz.html`) then **send** it to both Sevan and Sam on Slack via direct message.\n\n\n",
