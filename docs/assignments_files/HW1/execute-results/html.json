Being able to look at and make sense of code that you did not write yourself is an invaluable skill and an important one to practice throughout your learning journey. Here, you'll be asked to interpret and annotate `ggplot2` code written by someone else. This will likely require running code (both as a whole *and* line-by-line), as well as Googling and/or reading documentation.\n\n*I recognize that there is (likely) **a lot** of new code presented here, and that we haven't covered much at all yet in this course. This is intentionally an exercise is resourcefulness! By the end of this exercise, you should feel a bit more confident in your ability to interpret (and maybe even reuse!) code written by others.*\n\n[**Annotate the following code**]{.teal-text}, adapted from [Christophe Nicault's](https://github.com/cnicault) visualization titled, ***Evolution of deaths from indoor air pollution*** ([original code](https://github.com/cnicault/tidytuesday/blob/master/2022/2022-15-indoor_air_pollution/indoor_air_pollution.Rmd)) -- to enlarge image (in Chrome) **right-click on image** > **Open Image in New Tab**:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/indoor-poll-ggplot.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can find metadata and additional information about the data set on the [rfordatascience/tidytuesday (2022-04-12) `readme.md`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-04-12/readme.md#data-dictionary). **Note:** A select few lines of code have already been annotated for you.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n## Click here to expand the code\n\nInstall the following packages (if you don't already have them) using `install.packages(\"package_name\")` or `install.packages(\"package_name1\", \"package_name2\", ...)`:\n\n- [`{tidytuesdayR}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytuesdayR/index.html)\n- [`{tidyverse}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)\n- [`{patchwork}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html)\n- [`{showtext}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/showtext/index.html)\n- [`{sysfonts}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sysfonts/index.html)\n- [`{countrycode}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/countrycode/index.html)\n- [`{glue}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glue/index.html)\n- [`{scales}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/index.html)\n- [`{ragg}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ragg/index.html)\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- See lines 114 and 120 (among others) for examples of code annotations -- aim to include this level of detail. \n- Writing clean annotations makes it easier for you and others to read them -- I love using the [`{ARTofR}` package](https://github.com/Hzhang-ouce/ARTofR) to create titles, dividers, and block comments in my scripts and Qmd/Rmd files. Read more about how to create different dividers using the `{ARTofR}` package on [this resource page](http://localhost:7166/clean-code-guide.html#annotating-code) of the course website.\n- Pull up documentation for a function directly in RStudio's **Help** pane by running `?function_name` in the console. Vignettes and `pkgdown` sites are incredible resources as well (e.g. here is a [vignette](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/vignettes/patchwork.html) and the [pkgdown](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) site for the `{patchwork}` package)\n- If you don't immediately understand the purpose of a line/chunk of code, skip over it (temporarily) and continue working your way through the following code -- it oftentimes becomes more evident given additional context.\n- Plots may look *super* squished in the RStudio Viewer pane -- use the **Zoom** button to pop them open in a separate window.\n- **Keep in mind:** While this is fairly complex ggplot code, remember that it's constructed in layers -- meaning you can run code line-by-line to see exactly how the plot is changing with each new layer. You may come across functions and arguments that you're already familiar with (yay!), and of course, others that are totally new.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                                  1. setup                                ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#......ANNOTATE (generally, what does this code block do?).......\nlibrary(tidyverse) #

Your final assignment is meant to combine nearly all of the course learning outcomes(!):\n\n- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience\n- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that it’s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations\n- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing, visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically {ggplot2} + ggplot2 extension packages\n- write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others\n- apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations \n\nThis week, we'll mostly be focused on some prep work. Read the Description, below, for details.\n\n## Description \n\n*A small part of each homework assignment will be dedicated to working on a series of data visualizations which will be due as part of Assignment #4 at the end of the quarter.* Assignment #4 will ask you to build three related, but different data visualizations -- all which will use the same data set(s), but present those data differently for three different audiences / purposes:\n\n1. **a visualization for a general audience (i.e. without domain expertise)** -- this data visualization may be designed to prompt conversation, clearly display findings (without the use of jargon), and/or may even blend both art and science\n2. **a visualization to be included in a paper, technical documentation, or report** -- this visualization should tell a story, but can include much more detail, more data, more domain-specific language, etc.\n3. **a visualization that you could include in a presentation** -- you might imagine an audience with familiarity with your domain, but they only have a brief amount of time to process the information being presented; key takeaways should be clearly highlighted, and you may have multiple versions, each with an added layer (as if you're animating pieces of your visualization onto a slide) \n\n[**This week, you’ll focus on finding data that interest you and begin brainstorming some questions that you might explore / answer using those data.**]{.teal-text} \n\nYour data set(s) should -- to some degree -- have an environmental focus. It may be related to a past project, or even your current Capstone or GP. It may also be a completely new data set(s), unrelated to anything you're currently working on. Some places to check out if you're looking for data (you are not limited to just these data sources): \n\n- **[Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/)** -- is a weekly newsletter (and seasonal podcast) of useful / curious data sets, published by [Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://www.jsvine.com/)\n- **[awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)** -- a repository containing a list of topic-centric public data sources in high quality. They are collected and tidied from blogs, answers, and user responses\n- **[DataOne](https://www.dataone.org/)** -- a repository of data repositories! Search across all member repositories (including repositories like [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/advancedSearch.jsp), [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/catalog), [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), etc.) for environmental data (along with curated metadata records)\n- **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)** - Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to find and publish data, as well as enter competitions to solve data science challenges\n\n<!-- ***Note:** While we will not be working with spatial data models or building maps in EDS 240, you are welcome to use spatial data for this assignment if you are comfortable and excited to do so. We will not be able to offer as much support on the technical implementation of building maps-based visualizations, though the fundamental concepts of data communication and design theory that we'll be learning throughout this course will still apply. Relying on resources and knowledge from [EDS 223: Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing](https://ryoliver.github.io/EDS_223_spatial_analysis/) will be critical for anyone pursuing this option.* -->\n\n[**Once you've found your data set(s), answer the following questions:**]{.teal-text}\n\n- [ ] **1.** Describe your data set(s). Be sure to address the following [**(<=4 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n    - [ ] **1a.** Where did you find these data?\n    - [ ] **1b.** What variables does it contain? Is there sufficient metadata for understanding what those variables are?\n    - [ ] **1c.** Describe how these data related to the environment\n- [ ] **2.** What steps are involved in downloading or accessing the data (e.g. \"I can download using a button via this online portal,\" \"There's an R package for scraping the data,\" \"I need to use an API to scrape the data,\" etc.)? [**(1-2 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **3.** What question(s) do you want to answer using these data (it's okay if these questions evolve over time)? [**(<=4 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **4.** Will you need to combine multiple data sets to successfully answer your question(s)? If so, have you found all the necessary data? Do you have a way to combine it? [**(<=4 sentences)**]{.peach-text}\n- [ ] **Optional:** Import your data into R! (this will be a part of the next homework assignment) **IMPORTANT:** If your data files are large (>2GB) DO NOT push your data to GitHub -- instead, add your data file(s) or entire data folder to your `.gitignore` (you'll practice this in Discussion section this week).\n\n## Rubric (specifications)\n\nYou must complete the following, as detailed below, to receive a \"Satisfactory\" mark for Assignment #1, Part II:\n\n**Complete the following step under your own personal GitHub profile, *not* in GitHub Classrooms:**\n\n- [ ] create a GitHub repository named `lastName-eds240-HW4`, which is where you'll be doing any / all work related to Assignment #4. Be sure to make your repository public, initialize your repository with a README, and add a `.gitignore` file.\n\n**Complete the following steps in your GitHub Classroom repo (`eds240-HW1/Part2.qmd`):**\n\n- [ ] link to (or otherwise prove the existence of) at least one data set that you plan to use for Assignment #4\n- [ ] answer all parts of the four concluding questions, adhering to the length requirements specified at the end of each question prompt; you *do not* need to complete the **optional** importing of data -- if you *do* want to import your data, be sure to do so in your `lastName-eds240-HW4` repository\n- [ ] we should be able to render `Part2.qmd` without errors \n\n<br>\n\n::: {.center-text .large-fa-icon .teal-text}\n\n{{< fa table title=\"A data table with two columns and two rows\" >}} End Part II {{< fa table title=\"A data table with two columns and two rows\" >}}\n\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n",
