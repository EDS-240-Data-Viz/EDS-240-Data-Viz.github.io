    "text": "Description\nMuch of your time as a data scientist will be spent looking at code written by others – maybe you’re trying to learn from and adapt someone else’s code for your own work, or perhaps you’ve been asked to conduct a code review for a colleague. Being able to look at and make sense of code that you did not write yourself is an invaluable skill and an important one to practice throughout your learning journey. Here, you’ll be asked to interpret and annotate ggplot2 code written by someone else. This will likely require running code (both as a whole and line-by-line), as well as Googling and/or reading documentation.\nI recognize that there is (likely) a lot of new code presented here, and that we haven’t covered much at all yet in this course. This is intentionally an exercise is resourcefulness! By the end of this exercise, you should feel a bit more confident in your ability to interpret (and maybe even reuse!) code written by others.\nAnnotate the following code, adapted from Christophe Nicault’s visualization titled, Evolution of deaths from indoor air pollution (original code).:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find metadata and additional information on the rfordatascience/tidytuesday (2022-04-12) readme.md. Note: A select few lines of code have already been annotated for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to expand the code\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the following packages (if you don’t already have them) using install.packages(\"package_name\") or install.packages(\"package_name1\", \"package_name2\", ...):\n\n{tidytuesdayR}\n{tidyverse}\n{patchwork}\n{showtext}\n{sysfonts}\n{countrycode}\n{glue}\n{scales}\n{ragg}\n\nTips:\n\nSee lines 114 and 120 for examples of code annotations – aim to include this level of detail\nI love using the {ARTofR} package to create titles, dividers, and block comments in my scripts and Qmd/Rmd files\nIf you don’t immediately understand the purpose of a line/chunk of code, skip over it (temporarily) and continue working your way through the following code – it oftentimes becomes more evident given additional context\nPlots may look super squished in the Viewer – use the Zoom button to pop them open in a separate window\nKeep in mind: While this is fairly complex ggplot code, remember that it’s constructed in layers – meaning you can run code line-by-line to see exactly how the plot is changing with each new layer. You may come across functions and arguments that you’re already familiar with (yay!), and of course, others that are totally new.\n\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                                  1. setup                                ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#......ANNOTATE (generally, what does this code block do?).......\nlibrary(tidyverse) #

    "text": "Description\nA small part of each homework assignment will be dedicated to working on a series of data visualizations which will be due as part of Assignment #4 at the end of the quarter. Assignment #4 will ask you to build three related, but different data visualizations – all which will use the same data set(s), but present those data differently for three different audiences / purposes:\n\na visualization for a general audience (i.e. without domain expertise) – this data visualization may be designed to prompt conversation, clearly display findings (without the use of jargon), and/or may even blend both art and science\na visualization to be included in a paper, technical documentation, or report – this visualization should tell a story, but can include much more detail, more data, more domain-specific language, etc.\na visualization that you could include in presentation – you might imagine an audience with familiarity with your domain, but they only have a brief amount of time to process the information being presented; key takeaways should be clearly highlighted, and you may have multiple versions, each with an added layer (as if you’re animating pieces of your visualization onto a slide)\n\nThis week, you’ll focus on finding data that interest you and begin brainstorming some questions that you might explore / answer using those data.\nYour data set(s) should – to some degree – have an environmental focus. It may be related to a past project, or even your current Capstone or GP. It may also be a completely new data set(s), unrelated to anything you’re currently working on. Some places to check out if you’re looking for data (you are not limited to just these data sources):\n\nData is Plural – is a weekly newsletter (and seasonal podcast) of useful / curious data sets, published by Jeremy Singer-Vine\nDataOne – a repository of data repositories! Search across all member repositories (including repositories like EDI Data Portal, Arctic Data Center, KNB, etc.) for environmental data (along with curated metadata records)\nKaggle Datasets - Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to find and publish data, as well as enter competitions to solve data science challenges\n\nNote: While we will not be working with spatial data models or building maps in EDS 240, you are welcome to use spatial data for this assignment if you are comfortable and excited to do so. We will not be able to offer as much support on the technical implementation of building maps-based visualizations, though the fundamental concepts of data communication and design theory that we’ll be learning throughout this course will still apply. Relying on resources and knowledge from EDS 223: Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing will be critical for anyone pursuing this option.\nOnce you’ve found your data set(s), answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is your data set(s) of? Be sure to include how it is related to the environment, if it’s not immediately clear from your explanation. (&lt;=4 sentences)\nWhat steps are involved in downloading or accessing the data (e.g. “I can download using a button via this online portal,” “There’s an R package for scraping the data,” “I need to use an API to scrape the data,” etc.)? (1-2 sentences)\nWhat question(s) do you want to answer using these data? (&lt;=4 sentences)\nWill you need to combine multiple data sets to successfully answer your question(s)? If so, have you found all the necessary data? Do you have a way to combine it? (&lt;=4 sentences)\nOptional: Import your data into R! (this will be a part of the next homework assignment) IMPORTANT: If your data files are large (&gt;2GB) DO NOT push your data to GitHub. We’ll talk more about this during the next assignment.\n\nTODO: ADD MORE QUESTIONS HERE"

Research and long-term ecological and environmental monitoring data is collected within a 10,000 square kilometer area of the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, which includes the Santa Barbara Channel, coastal watersheds, small estuaries, and sandy beaches that border the Channel. You can explore the full data catalog.\n\n\n\nThere are five coastal rocky reef research sites at which the SBC LTER collects long-term monitoring data:\n\nNaples Reef (NAPL)\nIsla Vista Reef (IVEE)\nArroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE)\nMohawk Reef (MOHK)\nCarpinteria Reef (CARP)\n\nIn January 2012, Naples Reef and Isla Vista Reef were designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), prohibiting any future take of lobsters (along with other living marine resources). Since then, the SBC LTER has conducted annual (late summer) benthic surveys at each of the above five sites, where SCUBA divers record lobster abundance and sizes. Explore the metadata for more information.\n\n\n\nReed, D, R. Miller. 2023.

I was interested in the SBC LTER: Spiny lobster in California Collection, which includes three different data sets. I specifically chose, Lobster abundace, size, and fishing pressure – here, you’ll find lots of metadata, including people and organizations involved in this data collection, temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, methods and protocols, and links to data files. Additionally, you’ll see a link to the EDI Data Portal (top right corner), which is the data repository that maintains all data and metadata produced by the LTER. EDI assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to each version of a data package (data package = data + metadata; SBC LTER updates this data set each year when new data is collected – each update receives a new DOI).\nDownload or import the data. You can download the data file from either the SBC LTER Data Catalog or the EDI Data Package. However I prefer reading in the data directly from online (that way, I don’t need to worry about storing large data files). I recommend doing this from the EDI Data Package (rather than the SBC LTER Data Catalog), since the DOI ensures you can re-reference the exact same version, even after the data set is updated with new data (SBC LTER Data Catalog only has a download link for the most up-to-date version of the data).
