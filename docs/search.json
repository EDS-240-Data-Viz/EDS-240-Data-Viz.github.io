    "text": "Description\nMuch of your time as a data scientist will be spent looking at code written by others – maybe you’re trying to learn from and adapt someone else’s code for your own work, or perhaps you’ve been asked to conduct a code review for a colleague. Being able to look at and make sense of code that you did not write yourself is an invaluable skill and an important one to practice throughout your learning journey. Here, you’ll be asked to interpret and annotate ggplot2 code written by someone else. This will likely require running code (both as a whole and line-by-line), as well as Googling and/or reading documentation.\nAnnotate the following code, adapted from Christophe Nicault’s visualization titled, Evolution of deaths from indoor air pollution (original code).:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find metadata and additional information on the rfordatascience/tidytuesday (2022-04-12) readme.md. Note: A select few lines of code have already been annotated for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to expand the code\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the following packages (if you don’t already have them) using install.packages(\"package_name\") or install.packages(\"package_name1\", \"package_name2\", ...):\n\n{tidytuesdayR}\n{tidyverse}\n{patchwork}\n{showtext}\n{sysfonts}\n{countrycode}\n{glue}\n{scales}\n{ragg}\n\nTips:\n\nSee lines 114 and 120 for examples of code annotations – aim to include this level of detail\nI love using the {ARTofR} package to create titles, dividers, and block comments in my scripts and Qmd/Rmd files\nIf you don’t immediately understand the purpose of a line/chunk of code, skip over it (temporarily) and continue working your way through the following code – it oftentimes becomes more evident given additional context\nPlots may look super squished in the Viewer – use the Zoom button to pop them open in a separate window\nKeep in mind: While this is fairly complex ggplot code, remember that it’s constructed in layers – meaning you can run code line-by-line to see exactly how the plot is changing with each new layer. You may come across functions and arguments that you’re already familiar with (yay!), and of course, others that are totally new.\n\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                                  1. setup                                ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#......ANNOTATE (generally, what does this code block do?).......\nlibrary(tidyverse) #

    "text": "Description\nIn class, we discussed a five-step workflow for breaking down the process of transforming data into a visualization. The five steps are listed below:\n\nDetermine data type(s)\nDetermine appropriate visualization type(s)\nCreate a basic plot\nImprove clarity & take home message\nFinal touches / polishing\n\nHere, you will apply this workflow to visualize lobster size data across multiple rocky reef sites along the Santa Barbara coastline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the data\n\n\n\n\nAbout SBC LTER\nThe Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) site was established in 2000 as part of the LTER Network to understand the ecology of coastal kelp forest ecosystems. Research and long-term ecological and environmental monitoring data is collected within a 10,000 square kilometer area of the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, which includes the Santa Barbara Channel, coastal watersheds, small estuaries, and sandy beaches that border the Channel. You can explore the full data catalog.\n\n\nAbout the data set\nThere are five coastal rocky reef research sites at which the SBC LTER collects long-term monitoring data:\n\nNaples Reef (NAPL)\nIsla Vista Reef (IVEE)\nArroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE)\nMohawk Reef (MOHK)\nCarpinteria Reef (CARP)\n\nIn January 2012, Naples Reef and Isla Vista Reef were designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), prohibiting any future take of lobsters (along with other living marine resources). Since then, the SBC LTER has conducted annual (late summer) benthic surveys at each of the above five sites, where SCUBA divers record lobster abundance and sizes. Explore the metadata for more information.\n\n\nData citation\nReed, D, R. Miller. 2023. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012 ver 9. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/3595322687af94cd532620ad9db94c77.\n\n\nFinding this data set\nKnowing how to search for data can be tricky! Here’s how I accessed this particular data set, should you want to search for LTER data yourself, in the future:\n\nFilter the SBC LTER Data Catalog for data sets related to Reef/Kelp Forest habitats (check the box next to the habitat type of interest, or filter by measurement type or LTER Core Research Area). This produces a table of data collections, descriptions, and links to individual data and metadata records.\nChoose a data set of interest. I was interested in the SBC LTER: Spiny lobster in California Collection, which includes three different data sets. I specifically chose, Lobster abundace, size, and fishing pressure – here, you’ll find lots of metadata, including people and organizations involved in this data collection, temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, methods and protocols, and links to data files. Additionally, you’ll see a link to the EDI Data Portal (top right corner), which is the data repository that maintains all data and metadata produced by the LTER. EDI assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to each version of a data package (data package = data + metadata; SBC LTER updates this data set each year when new data is collected – each update receives a new DOI).\nDownload or import the data. You can download the data file from either the SBC LTER Data Catalog or the EDI Data Package. However I prefer reading in the data directly from online (that way, I don’t need to worry about storing large data files). I recommend doing this from the EDI Data Package (rather than the SBC LTER Data Catalog), since the DOI ensures you can re-reference the exact same version, even after the data set is updated with new data (SBC LTER Data Catalog only has a download link for the most up-to-date version of the data). To do so, right click on the Download Data button, then select Copy Link Address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this url inside read_csv() to import the data into your script or Qmd/Rmd file:\n\nlobster_data &lt;- read_csv(\"https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.9&entityid=f32823fba432f58f66c06b589b7efac6\")\n\n\n\n\nGiven the above data set, apply the five-step workflow to create a data visualization that explores how lobster size differs across each of the five coastal rocky reef SBC LTER sites for the years 2012 (the IVEE and NAPL were established as MPAs) and 2022 (10 years later).\nYou must complete steps 1 - 3 (you may need to do some Googling or reference documentation to determine what geom_* to use when creating your basic plot).\n\n(step 1) write out, in words, the data types of the variables from the above data set (you only need to do this for the variables used in creating your plot) (1-2 sentences)\n(step 2) write out, in words, the appropriate visualization types you considered given these data types (hint: revisit from Data to Viz for a helpful decision tree) (1-2 sentences)\n(step 3) write ggplot code to create a basic plot to visualize these data (this will first require some data wrangling)\n\nPhysically coding steps 4 & 5 is optional – instead, you may explain, in writing and/or by sketching out on paper, the following:\n\n(representing step 4) how you would improve plot clarity/the take home message(s) (consider the following prompts)? (2-3 sentences total)\n\nDo you see any trends that you may want to explore further and/or highlight?\nHow might you use colors and/or shapes to highlight important site groupings and/or years?\n\n(representing step 5) some design choices you might make as you polish off your data visualization (consider the following prompts) (2-3 sentences total)\n\nWhat plot elements should you update to really polish up this visualization?\nWhat text might you include?\n\n\nNote: Steps 4 and 5, above, are thought exercises – it’s okay if you don’t yet know exactly how to approach answering these (we’ll be spending time during these first few weeks of class talking about data communication and design theory), but do your best to write down a few things that you think would help to improve both the clarity and overall design of your data visualization ."

    "text": "Description\nA small part of each homework assignment will be dedicated to working on a series of data visualizations which will be due as part of Assignment #4 at the end of the quarter. Assignment #4 will ask you to build three related, but different data visualizations – all which will use the same data set(s), but present those data differently for three different audiences / purposes:\n\na visualization for a general audience (i.e. without domain expertise) – this data visualization may be designed to prompt conversation, clearly display findings (without the use of jargon), and/or may even blend both art and science\na visualization to be included in a paper, technical documentation, or report – this visualization should tell a story, but can include much more detail, more data, more domain-specific language, etc.\na visualization that you could include in presentation – you might imagine an audience with familiarity with your domain, but they only have a brief amount of time to process the information being presented; key takeaways should be clearly highlighted, and you may have multiple versions, each with an added layer (as if you’re animating pieces of your visualization onto a slide)\n\nThis week, you’ll focus on finding data that interest you and begin brainstorming some questions that you might explore / answer using those data.\nYour data set(s) should – to some degree – have an environmental focus. It may be related to a past project, or even your current Capstone or GP. It may also be a completely new data set(s), unrelated to anything you’re currently working on. Some places to check out if you’re looking for data (you are not limited to just these data sources):\n\nData is Plural – is a weekly newsletter (and seasonal podcast) of useful / curious data sets, published by Jeremy Singer-Vine\nDataOne – a repository of data repositories! Search across all member repositories (including repositories like EDI Data Portal, Arctic Data Center, KNB, etc.) for environmental data (along with curated metadata records)\nKaggle Datasets - Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to find and publish data, as well as enter competitions to solve data science challenges\n\nNote: While we will not be working with spatial data models or building maps in EDS 240, you are welcome to use spatial data for this assignment if you are comfortable and excited to do so. We will not be able to offer as much support on the technical implementation of building maps-based visualizations, though the fundamental concepts of data communication and design theory that we’ll be learning throughout this course will still apply. Relying on resources and knowledge from EDS 223: Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing will be critical for anyone pursuing this option.\nOnce you’ve found your data set(s), answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is your data set(s) of? Be sure to include how it is related to the environment, if it’s not immediately clear from your explanation. (&lt;=4 sentences)\nWhat steps are involved in downloading or accessing the data (e.g. “I can download using a button via this online portal,” “There’s an R package for scraping the data,” “I need to use an API to scrape the data,” etc.)? (1-2 sentences)\nWhat question(s) do you want to answer using these data? (&lt;=4 sentences)\nWill you need to combine multiple data sets to successfully answer your question(s)? If so, have you found all the necessary data? Do you have a way to combine it? (&lt;=4 sentences)\nOptional: Import your data into R! (this will be a part of the next homework assignment) IMPORTANT: If your data files are large (&gt;2GB) DO NOT push your data to GitHub. We’ll talk more about this during the next assignment."

The graphic below shows the order in which you should approach different resources for help:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you decide you’re going to ask a question to a peer / TA / instructor, be sure to (borrowed from Dr. Allison Horst’s Troubleshooting 101 lecture, EDS 221):\n\nProvide context. For example, “I’m trying to do this…” or “I’m working on the task where we do this…”\nShare the specific challenge. “I’m specifically trying to [insert function / package] to do this thing.”\nShare what happens and what you’ve learned. “I repeatedly get an error message that says [this]. I’ve tried [this] and [this]”\nShow your code ideally with a reprex that they can run / test.\nValue and expect the Socratic method, especially in classes and workshops – our goal is to provide critical thinking that is transferable, not just to provide a quick fix for a single error.\n\n\nAnd don’t forget to a look back some of our suggested troubleshooting and Googling tips in Teach Me How to Google, below:"
