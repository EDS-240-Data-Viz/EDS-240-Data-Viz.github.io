    "text": "Discussion Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, you may have heard/read something like, “Data scientists spend 80% of their time preparing their data for analysis and/or visualization.” And while that may not be totally accurate for all data scientists or all projects, you will spend lots of time wrestling with data. You’ll spend this week’s discussion cleaning up a messy data set on hydraulic fracturing aka fracking.\nThis week’s data comes courtesy of Jeremy Singer-Vine’s Data is Plural weekly newsletter of useful/curious data sets (the 2023.09.27 edition). Singer-Vine’s description:\n\nSince launching in 2011, FracFocus has become the largest registry of hydraulic fracturing chemical disclosures in the US. The database, available to explore online and download in bulk, contains 210,000+ such disclosures from fracking operators; it details the location, timing, and water volume of each fracking job, plus the names and amounts of chemicals used. The project is managed by the Ground Water Protection Council, “a nonprofit 501(c)6 organization whose members consist of state ground water regulatory agencies”. As seen in: The latest installment of the New York Times’ Uncharted Water series.\n\nBefore coming to section, please be sure to:\n\nInstall the following packages:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\") # tools for cleaning dirty data\ninstall.packages(\"usdata\") # demographic data on the United States at the county and state levels spanning multiple years\n\n\nDownload the data as a zip file (click the Download CSV Data button at the bottom of the page) and unzip. We’ll only be using the file named registryupload_1.csv – rename it as fracking-20240110.csv\nSave fracking-20240110.csv to your class repo in the following location: EDS-240-class-examples/week1/data/fracking-20240110.csv\nWe don’t want to push any data in our repo to GitHub (GitHub enforces file size limits, and you’ll run into some serious headaches when you try to push a file that’s too big) – to avoid doing this, we can add our data files to our .gitignore file, which, as the name implies, is a collection of files that we want Git to ignore. Open up your .gitignore file and add the following line (anywhere is fine, but it makes sense to add it beneath the last line):\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n# ignore any folder named `data/` within folders named `week__` (* acts as a wildcard)\n/week*/data/\n\n\nNotice that when you Save your modified .gitignore file, untracked data files at the specified file path disappear from your Git tab in RStudio, and a modified .gitignore file appears in it’s place (this is what we want!). Stage/add, commit, and push .gitignore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example repo with three folders: week1/, week2/, and other-stuff/. Each of those folders has a subfolder named data/, and each data/ folder contains a .csv file. Adding the line, /week*/data/ to the .gitignore tells Git to ignore folders (and their contents) named data/ that are within a parent folder named week__ (the * acts as a wildcard). If we wanted to ignore all three data/ folders (including other-stuff/data/), we can instead include /*/data/ to our .gitignore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete code for week 1 discussion (fracking)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                                    setup                                 ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#..........................load packages.........................\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n#......................import fracking data......................\nfracking &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"week1\", \"data\", \"fracking-20240110.csv\"))\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                        clean/wrangle fracking data                       ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nfracking_clean &lt;- fracking |&gt; \n  \n  # clean column names ----\n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt; \n  \n  # clean up dates ----\n  mutate(job_start_date = str_remove(job_start_date, \" AM\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(datetime_start = mdy_hms(job_start_date)) |&gt; \n  mutate(year = year(datetime_start)) |&gt; \n\n  # select relevant cols ----\n  select(datetime_start, year, state_name, county_name, well_name, total_base_water_volume) |&gt; \n  \n  # convert state_name from string to factor ----\n  mutate(state_name = as.factor(state_name)) |&gt; \n  \n  # filter out non-state names ----\n  filter(!state_name %in% c(\"Beaver\", \"Beckham\", \"Harper\", \"Hemphill\", \"Midland\", \"Red River\", \"Roosevelt\", \"Rusk\", \"State\", \"WARD\")) |&gt; \n  \n  # rename state_name to something shorter for typing out when using case_when (not necessary) ----\n  rename(sn = state_name) |&gt; \n  \n  # make all words title case ----\n  mutate(sn = str_to_title(sn)) |&gt; \n  \n  # fix misspelled state names ----\n  mutate(sn = case_when(\n    sn == \"Colordao\" ~ \"Colorado\",\n    sn == \"Loiusiana\" ~ \"Louisiana\",\n    sn == \"Louisianna\" ~ \"Louisiana\",\n    sn == \"Lousiana\" ~ \"Louisiana\",\n    sn == \"New Mexcio\" ~ \"New Mexico\",\n    sn == \"Norh Dakota\" ~ \"North Dakota\",\n    sn == \"Norht Dakota\" ~ \"North Dakota\",\n    sn == \"North  Dakota\" ~ \"North Dakota\",\n    sn == \"North Dakata\" ~ \"North Dakota\",\n    sn == \"North Dakotta\" ~ \"North Dakota\",\n    sn == \"Noth Dakota\" ~ \"North Dakota\",\n    sn == \"Pennslvania\" ~ \"Pennsylvania\",\n    sn == \"Pennsylavania\" ~ \"Pennsylvania\",\n    sn == \"Pennsylvanya\" ~ \"Pennsylvania\",\n    sn == \"Penssylvania\" ~ \"Pennsylvania\",\n    sn == \"Texasa\" ~ \"Texas\",\n    sn == \"Texs\" ~ \"Texas\", \n    sn == \"West Viginia\" ~ \"West Virginia\",\n    sn == \"Wyominng\" ~ \"Wyoming\", \n    TRUE ~ sn # copy over rest of state names from as-is\n  )) |&gt; \n  \n  # remove rows that have a ? mark ----\n  filter(!str_detect(sn, \"\\\\?\")) |&gt; # `?` is a special chr; escape with `\\\\` prefix\n  \n  # make all works uppercase (so that we can covert abb to state names) ----\n  mutate(sn = str_to_upper(sn)) |&gt; \n  \n  # mutate abbs to full state names ----\n  mutate(sn = ifelse(test = str_length(sn) == 2, \n                     yes = usdata::abbr2state(sn),\n                     no = sn)) |&gt; \n  \n  # make all words title case again ----\n  mutate(sn = str_to_title(sn)) |&gt; \n  \n  # create a column of just state abbs ----\n  mutate(state_abb = usdata::state2abbr(sn)) |&gt; \n  \n  # rename sn to state_name again for clarity ----\n  rename(state_name = sn, total_base_water_volume_gal = total_base_water_volume) |&gt; \n  \n  # move state_abb col after state_name col ----\n  relocate(state_abb, .after = state_name) |&gt; \n  \n  # remove obs that don't have a measurement for total_base_water_volume (NA) ----\n  drop_na(total_base_water_volume_gal)\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##      basic violin plot of total water used / job (top 3 states, 2015)    ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nfracking_areas |&gt; \n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Texas\", \"Colorado\", \"North Dakota\")) |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2015) |&gt; \n  # filter(total_base_water_volume_gal &lt; 70000000) |&gt; # uncomment this line to plot with two extreme outliers excluded\n  group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n  mutate(state_name = fct_relevel(state_name, c(\"Texas\", \"Colorado\", \"North Dakota\"))) |&gt; # pipe directly into ggplot \n  ggplot(aes(x = state_name, y = total_base_water_volume_gal)) +\n  geom_violin()"

    "text": "Description\nMuch of your time as a data scientist will be spent looking at code written by others – maybe you’re trying to learn from and adapt someone else’s code for your own work, or perhaps you’ve been asked to conduct a code review for a colleague. Being able to look at and make sense of code that you did not write yourself is an invaluable skill and an important one to practice throughout your learning journey. Here, you’ll be asked to interpret and annotate ggplot2 code written by someone else. This will likely require running code (both as a whole and line-by-line), as well as Googling and/or reading documentation.\nI recognize that there is (likely) a lot of new code presented here, and that we haven’t covered much at all yet in this course. This is intentionally an exercise is resourcefulness! By the end of this exercise, you should feel a bit more confident in your ability to interpret (and maybe even reuse!) code written by others.\nAnnotate the following code, adapted from Christophe Nicault’s visualization titled, Evolution of deaths from indoor air pollution (original code) – to enlarge image (in Chrome) right-click on image &gt; Open Image in New Tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find metadata and additional information about the data set on the rfordatascience/tidytuesday (2022-04-12) readme.md. Note: A select few lines of code have already been annotated for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to expand the code\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the following packages (if you don’t already have them) using install.packages(\"package_name\") or install.packages(\"package_name1\", \"package_name2\", ...):\n\n{tidytuesdayR}\n{tidyverse}\n{patchwork}\n{showtext}\n{sysfonts}\n{countrycode}\n{glue}\n{scales}\n{ragg}\n\nTips:\n\nSee lines 114 and 120 (among others) for examples of code annotations – aim to include this level of detail.\nWriting clean annotations makes it easier for you and others to read them – I love using the {ARTofR} package to create titles, dividers, and block comments in my scripts and Qmd/Rmd files. Read more about how to create different dividers using the {ARTofR} package on this resource page of the course website.\nPull up documentation for a function directly in RStudio’s Help pane by running ?function_name in the console. Vignettes and pkgdown sites are incredible resources as well (e.g. here is a vignette and the pkgdown site for the {patchwork} package)\nIf you don’t immediately understand the purpose of a line/chunk of code, skip over it (temporarily) and continue working your way through the following code – it oftentimes becomes more evident given additional context.\nPlots may look super squished in the RStudio Viewer pane – use the Zoom button to pop them open in a separate window.\nKeep in mind: While this is fairly complex ggplot code, remember that it’s constructed in layers – meaning you can run code line-by-line to see exactly how the plot is changing with each new layer. You may come across functions and arguments that you’re already familiar with (yay!), and of course, others that are totally new.\n\n\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                                  1. setup                                ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n#......ANNOTATE (generally, what does this code block do?).......\nlibrary(tidyverse) #

Assignment #4 will ask you to build three related, but different data visualizations – all which will use the same data set(s), but present those data differently for three different audiences / purposes:\n\na visualization for a general audience (i.e. without domain expertise) – this data visualization may be designed to prompt conversation, clearly display findings (without the use of jargon), and/or may even blend both art and science\na visualization to be included in a paper, technical documentation, or report – this visualization should tell a story, but can include much more detail, more data, more domain-specific language, etc.\na visualization that you could include in a presentation – you might imagine an audience with familiarity with your domain, but they only have a brief amount of time to process the information being presented; key takeaways should be clearly highlighted, and you may have multiple versions, each with an added layer (as if you’re animating pieces of your visualization onto a slide)\n\nThis week, you’ll focus on finding data that interest you and begin brainstorming some questions that you might explore / answer using those data.\nYour data set(s) should – to some degree – have an environmental focus. It may be related to a past project, or even your current Capstone or GP. It may also be a completely new data set(s), unrelated to anything you’re currently working on. Some places to check out if you’re looking for data (you are not limited to just these data sources):\n\nData is Plural – is a weekly newsletter (and seasonal podcast) of useful / curious data sets, published by Jeremy Singer-Vine\nawesome-public-datasets – a repository containing a list of topic-centric public data sources in high quality. They are collected and tidied from blogs, answers, and user responses\nDataOne – a repository of data repositories! Search across all member repositories (including repositories like EDI Data Portal, Arctic Data Center, KNB, etc.) for environmental data (along with curated metadata records)\nKaggle Datasets - Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to find and publish data, as well as enter competitions to solve data science challenges\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve found your data set(s), answer the following questions:\n\n1. Describe your data set(s). Be sure to address the following (&lt;=4 sentences)\n\n1a. Where did you find these data?\n1b. What variables does it contain? Is there sufficient metadata for understanding what those variables are?\n1c. Describe how these data related to the environment\n\n2. What steps are involved in downloading or accessing the data (e.g. “I can download using a button via this online portal,” “There’s an R package for scraping the data,” “I need to use an API to scrape the data,” etc.)? (1-2 sentences)\n3. What question(s) do you want to answer using these data (it’s okay if these questions evolve over time)? (&lt;=4 sentences)\n4. Will you need to combine multiple data sets to successfully answer your question(s)? If so, have you found all the necessary data? Do you have a way to combine it? (&lt;=4 sentences)\nOptional: Import your data into R! (this will be a part of the next homework assignment) IMPORTANT: If your data files are large (&gt;2GB) DO NOT push your data to GitHub – instead, add your data file(s) or entire data folder to your .gitignore (you’ll practice this in Discussion section this week)."

The five steps are listed below:\n\nDetermine data type(s)\nDetermine appropriate visualization type(s)\nCreate a basic plot\nImprove clarity & take home message\nFinal touches / polishing\n\nHere, you will apply this workflow to visualize lobster size data across multiple rocky reef sites along the Santa Barbara coastline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the data\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) site was established in 2000 as part of the LTER Network to understand the ecology of coastal kelp forest ecosystems. Research and long-term ecological and environmental monitoring data is collected within a 10,000 square kilometer area of the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, which includes the Santa Barbara Channel, coastal watersheds, small estuaries, and sandy beaches that border the Channel. You can explore the full data catalog.\n\n\n\nThere are five coastal rocky reef research sites at which the SBC LTER collects long-term monitoring data:\n\nNaples Reef (NAPL)\nIsla Vista Reef (IVEE)\nArroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE)\nMohawk Reef (MOHK)\nCarpinteria Reef (CARP)\n\nIn January 2012, Naples Reef and Isla Vista Reef were designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), prohibiting any future take of lobsters (along with other living marine resources). Since then, the SBC LTER has conducted annual (late summer) benthic surveys at each of the above five sites, where SCUBA divers record lobster abundance and sizes. Explore the metadata for more information.\n\n\n\nReed, D, R. Miller. 2023. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012 ver 9. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/3595322687af94cd532620ad9db94c77.\n\n\n\nKnowing how to search for data can be tricky! Here’s how I accessed this particular data set, should you want to search for LTER data yourself, in the future:\n\nFilter the SBC LTER Data Catalog for data sets related to Reef/Kelp Forest habitats (check the box next to the habitat type of interest, or filter by measurement type or LTER Core Research Area). This produces a table of data collections, descriptions, and links to individual data and metadata records.\nChoose a data set of interest. I was interested in the SBC LTER: Spiny lobster in California Collection, which includes three different data sets. I specifically chose, Lobster abundace, size, and fishing pressure – here, you’ll find lots of metadata, including people and organizations involved in this data collection, temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, methods and protocols, and links to data files. Additionally, you’ll see a link to the EDI Data Portal (top right corner), which is the data repository that maintains all data and metadata produced by the LTER. EDI assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to each version of a data package (data package = data + metadata; SBC LTER updates this data set each year when new data is collected – each update receives a new DOI).\nDownload or import the data. You can download the data file from either the SBC LTER Data Catalog or the EDI Data Package. However I prefer reading in the data directly from online (that way, I don’t need to worry about storing large data files). I recommend doing this from the EDI Data Package (rather than the SBC LTER Data Catalog), since the DOI ensures you can re-reference the exact same version, even after the data set is updated with new data (SBC LTER Data Catalog only has a download link for the most up-to-date version of the data).

Research and long-term ecological and environmental monitoring data is collected within a 10,000 square kilometer area of the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, which includes the Santa Barbara Channel, coastal watersheds, small estuaries, and sandy beaches that border the Channel. You can explore the full data catalog.\n\n\n\nThere are five coastal rocky reef research sites at which the SBC LTER collects long-term monitoring data:\n\nNaples Reef (NAPL)\nIsla Vista Reef (IVEE)\nArroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE)\nMohawk Reef (MOHK)\nCarpinteria Reef (CARP)\n\nIn January 2012, Naples Reef and Isla Vista Reef were designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), prohibiting any future take of lobsters (along with other living marine resources). Since then, the SBC LTER has conducted annual (late summer) benthic surveys at each of the above five sites, where SCUBA divers record lobster abundance and sizes. Explore the metadata for more information.\n\n\n\nReed, D, R. Miller. 2023.
