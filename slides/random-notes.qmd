plot data directly

e.g. plot income and expenses as separate lines or just plot a singe net income line? (latter) **plot your data directly, if difference matters more, plot the difference!** (need environmental example here)


-------

SOME TIPS

- baselines
- breaking up plots when data vary so much that presenting them all on a single chart renders it useless (e.g. use fracking data?)
- ordering variables / categories -- e.g. see trends across age groups by grouping bars by media (see pg 139) (NEED EDS EXAMPLE HERE)

--------

use logical & meaningful baselines

- bar, lollipops, histograms, etc should always have a 0 baseline -- cannot truncate when main visual cue is height/length measured from a common baseline
- scatterplot, line graph, ec. -- can be okay to truncate axes since main visual cue is position, not height/length
