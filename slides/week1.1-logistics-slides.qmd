["Traditional" grading can come with some challenges:]{.body-text-m}

<br>

::: incremental

**TL;DR:** assignments receive either "Satisfactory" or "Not Yet" marks; tokens can be used to revise/resubmit assignments, for assignment extensions, or to miss class; earn tokens by attending discussions
:::

::: incremental
- assignments receive either a **"Satisfactory"** or **"Not Yet"** mark
- each assignment will have a **clear rubric** (containing specifications) which outline what must be completed and how in order to receive a "Satisfactory" mark; *not* meeting all specifications results in a "Not Yet" mark
- students can **trade "tokens"** for the opportunity to:         
    - revise/resubmit assignments that receive a "Not Yet" mark
    - assignment extensions
    - to miss class
- students **earn tokens** (primarily) by attending discussion section

<br>

Everyone has different responsibilities & demands -- ***tokens give you the power and freedom to ask for the accommodations you need.***

<br>

You *do not* need to provide a reason to request an extension, resubmission, or to miss class, but *you must* have enough tokens to do so.
