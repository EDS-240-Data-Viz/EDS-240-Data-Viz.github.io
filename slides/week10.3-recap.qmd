line & area charts for visualizing evolution

line: 
- avoid spaghetti charts
- okay to cut the y-axis
- be mindful of aspect ratio

area
- like line, but filled in

stacked area: 
- evolution of whole + relative proportions of each OR choose proportioanl stacked area chart (% contribution of each)
- not good for studying evolution of individual groups

{chron} (dates / times), {naniar} (missing data)
{tidycensus} (census data)

{ggridges} (ridgeline plots)
{ggbeeswarm} (beeswarm plots)
{see} {violin dot plots}

visualizing rankings & numerical relationships
- bar & lollipop (basically the same) 
  - y-axis must start at 0
- dumbbell charts (difference between groups)
- scatterplots & bubble plots
- heatmaps & 2d density plots when you have too many data points
