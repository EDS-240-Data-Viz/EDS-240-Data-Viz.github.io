Trulia removed it's crime tab in 2022 after Redfin spoke out agains the practice: â[G]iven the long history of redlining and racist housing covenants in the United States thereâs too great a risk of this inaccuracy reinforcing racial bias. We believe that Redfinâand all real estate sitesâshould not show neighborhood crime data.â | Source: [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/trulia-to-drop-neighborhood-crime-data-from-home-listings-after-redfin-speaks-out-against-practice/) | For more on biases in crime statistics, check out [Buil-Gil et al.

- How you (dis)aggregate your data can tell drastically **different stories**
- Aggregation is often the **result of small sample sizes** (e.g. when there are too few observations, populations may be lumped together) -- this can obscure important stories about underrepresented groups
- The missing-data challenge is an essential consideration for both: 
    - **data collectors** (e.g. are folks with diverse experiences and perspectives involved in developing collection methods) and
    - **data communicators** (e.g. if data for specific groups are missing, how can we still be inclusive in our representation of them?)

[Data humanism]{.slide-title}

Giorgia Lupi

>  "I started to work with data in 2010, 2011, and I saw that most of the approach to data at the time was very much based on a statisticianâs background, and thatâs fantastic. But I was also interested in using data myself as an anchoring point to tell stories. I thought that **thereâs just more that we could do to actually represent our reality if we include context, anecdotal details, if we embrace the imperfections that are inherent to how we collect data**. And so, I started to just use these ideas in my practice, and I felt that I needed to just come up with an umbrella term for that. Data humanism was a good one, and **data humanism is an approach to data that tries to reconnect numbers to what they really stand for by adding less factual and more anecdotal information**."

- "Itâs really about what the audience would need to know first, so put yourself in the shoes of a reader or a user that will encounter your chart for the first time. And starting from there, try to design it in a way that can paint as full a picture as possible. Visualization is not about simplifying reality; itâs about providing an access to complexity."
- " I also think that in some contextsâagain, not everywhere, not if you have to design a dashboard for decision making on analytic dataâbut in some cases a warmer depiction of data can make people relate...And sometimes, if you get people to an emotional level, you might get them interested in learning more and spending more time."
- "Beauty is such an entry point for everything. You wouldnât buy an ugly dress just because itâs very functional. So, I feel thereâs nothing wrong with trying to make charts a little bit more beautiful."
