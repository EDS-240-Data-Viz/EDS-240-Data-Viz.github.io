what is data humanism?

Giorgia Lupi

>  "I started to work with data in 2010, 2011, and I saw that most of the approach to data at the time was very much based on a statistician’s background, and that’s fantastic. But I was also interested in using data myself as an anchoring point to tell stories. I thought that **there’s just more that we could do to actually represent our reality if we include context, anecdotal details, if we embrace the imperfections that are inherent to how we collect data**. And so, I started to just use these ideas in my practice, and I felt that I needed to just come up with an umbrella term for that. Data humanism was a good one, and **data humanism is an approach to data that tries to reconnect numbers to what they really stand for by adding less factual and more anecdotal information**."

- "It’s really about what the audience would need to know first, so put yourself in the shoes of a reader or a user that will encounter your chart for the first time. And starting from there, try to design it in a way that can paint as full a picture as possible. Visualization is not about simplifying reality; it’s about providing an access to complexity."
- " I also think that in some contexts—again, not everywhere, not if you have to design a dashboard for decision making on analytic data—but in some cases a warmer depiction of data can make people relate...And sometimes, if you get people to an emotional level, you might get them interested in learning more and spending more time."
- "Beauty is such an entry point for everything. You wouldn’t buy an ugly dress just because it’s very functional. So, I feel there’s nothing wrong with trying to make charts a little bit more beautiful."
