## Assignments

Earning "Satisfactory" marks on Self-reflections (SRs) and Homework Assignments (HWs) will determine your letter grade (e.g. A, B, etc.) for this course.

## End-of-class surveys

End-of-class surveys (EOCs) will become available at the end of each class (Mondays) and are due by end-of-day (11:55pm PT). Completing EOCs by the due dates / times will, in-part (along with class attendance), determine whether you earn a +/- on your course grade.

## Grade Tracker 

Use the Grade Tracker, below, to determine your course grade:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "55%" 
#| fig-alt: "The Grade Tracker table, which can be used to determine an individual's course grade based on the number of 'Satisfactory' assignments completed, as well as descriptions on how to earn and use tokens"
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "grade-tracker.png"))
```

[Redeem tokens](https://forms.gle/HcaMHQTgExKTnq9Q9) in exchange for assignment extensions, missing class, or to revise / resubmit an assignment that received a "Not Yet" mark.
